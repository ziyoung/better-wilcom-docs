# Patterned Stitching

![ProgramSplitSample.png](assets/ProgramSplitSample.png)EmbroideryStudio provides tools for creating patterns with needle penetrations. Apply offset fractions or partition lines to tatami fills for a variety of split-line effects. Alternatively, use Program Split or Flexi Split to create decorative fills from predefined patterns. Select from the library or create your own.

The Carving Stamp feature allows you to define patterns using a ‘carving stamp’ as a template. Use it also to create your own split lines when you want to add detail to filled objects.

This section explains how to create textures with tatami offsets and program splits. Create your own and add them to a custom library. Creating stitch patterns with carving stamps is covered as well as adding details with user-defined splits.
