# Add stamps to a library

This procedure starts when you click the enabled Add to Library button either on the Use Object tab or Digitize tab in the Carving Stamp docker.

Tip: The Carving Stamp feature can only use vector or embroidery objects as a basis for stamps. If you want to use a bitmap image, you can convert to vector format in CorelDRAW Graphics using the Bitmaps > Outline Trace command set.

## To add a stamp to a library...

1Select an object which you want to add to the library as a custom stamp.

- Digitize carving stamps on the spot using the Carving Stamp > Digitize tab.
- Define carving stamps using the Carving Stamp > Use Object tab.

3Select a set from the droplist or click the Create button to create a new library.

If you chose to create a new library set, use the New Pattern Set dialog to create a new stamp set. The newly created stamp set is displayed in the Set list when the Use Pattern tab is selected.
