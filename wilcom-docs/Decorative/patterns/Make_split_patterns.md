# Make split patterns

Make your own patterns to use in program split fills. Create patterns from the outlines of embroidery objects or from [drawing objects](../../glossary/glossary). Patterns you create can also be used for Flexi Split effects.

## To make a split pattern...

1. Select the object (or objects) you want to use for the pattern.
