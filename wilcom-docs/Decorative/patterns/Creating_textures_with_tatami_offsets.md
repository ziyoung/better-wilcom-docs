# Creating textures with tatami offsets

With tatami fills you can create patterns of needle penetrations. With only two offsets available, the number of patterns is limited, but even with small offsets, visible lines are produced. Partition lines, with up to eight offsets, can create more patterns. Using a random factor you can distribute needle penetrations randomly.

Tip: [Auto Split](../../glossary/glossary) can be used to create special textures in satin stitches as an alternative to tatami fill. [See Split satin stitches for details.](../../Quality/quality/Split_satin_stitches)
