Carving stamps can be moved, rotated, scaled, reshaped, and deleted individually in Reshape mode. As you transform carving stamps, needle penetrations in the underlying object are automatically updated.

## To reshape a carving stamp...

- Select an [embroidery object](../../glossary/glossary) in Reshape mode with carving stamps applied. A diamond selection handle is displayed at the center of each stamp.
