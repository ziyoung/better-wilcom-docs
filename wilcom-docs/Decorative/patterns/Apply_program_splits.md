You can apply Program Split to a wide variety of objects. You can adjust these either before or after applying the effect. Choose from a library of split patterns.

Note: Digitize the [stitch angle](../../glossary/glossary) carefully when creating objects with program splits. If rows are parallel with pattern lines, they will rarely intersect and the pattern may not be visible. A 45Â° stitch angle is suitable for most patterns.
