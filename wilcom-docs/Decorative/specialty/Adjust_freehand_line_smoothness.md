The Freehand tools have a special cursor. Adjust settings via the Freehand Smoothing toolbar. Also adjust curve ‘smoothing’ as you digitize.

## To adjust freehand line smoothness...

- Create a freehand design using outline and/or filled objects. The Freehand Smoothing toolbar opens.

- Adjust freehand line ‘smoothness’ by means of the slider bar. This controls the number of [control points](../../glossary/glossary) generated. Alternatively, adjust smoothing by means of the percentage value.

- Alternatively, press the Backspace key. The last point digitized is removed.
- Release the mouse to finish the outline at the last point digitized. Or press Esc to cancel input of the object.

Note: Objects created using the Freehand tools can be reshaped in the same way as objects created via conventional methods.
