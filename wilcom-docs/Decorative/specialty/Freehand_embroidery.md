# Freehand embroidery

![FreehandEmbroidery.png](assets/FreehandEmbroidery.png)The Freehand feature provides functionality similar to CorelDRAWÂ® Graphics Suite Freehand and Polyline tools. Freehand has many benefits. It lets you create designs with a hand-drawn appearance, something which is difficult to achieve through conventional digitizing methods. The aim is to mimic the fluid and free-flowing effects formed by means of freehand stitching techniques.
