## To create jagged edges...

- Choose the object you want to apply the effect to or toggle on before you start digitizing. It can be applied to satin or tatami fills with or without program splits. It doesn’t work with Contour stitch.
- Click the Jagged Edge icon. The effect is applied based on current Jagged Edge and stitch settings.
