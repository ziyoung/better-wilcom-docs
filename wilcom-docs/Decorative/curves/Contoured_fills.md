# Contoured fills

Contour is a curved fill stitch type which can be applied to Column A/B or Circle/Ring objects. It can also be used for outline stitching. Stitches follow the contours of a shape, creating a contoured, light and shade effect. Use it to create a sense of movement in contrast to flatter fills created by tatami stitching.
