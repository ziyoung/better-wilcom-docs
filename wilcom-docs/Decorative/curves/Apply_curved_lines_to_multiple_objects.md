You can apply Florentine Effect or Liquid Effect to multiple objects in a design. All objects share the same curved line.

## To apply a curved line to multiple objects...

1. Using the Digitize Run tool, digitize a guideline for the curve to follow. Digitize a second line if you want to apply Liquid Effect.

2. With the guideline selected, select Object > Use for Florentine Effect. This tags the digitized run as the default curve line.

::: tip
With two guidelines selected, the Object > Use for Liquid Effect command becomes available.

3. Select an object and click the Florentine Effect icon. Notice that the turning stitches follow the guideline.
