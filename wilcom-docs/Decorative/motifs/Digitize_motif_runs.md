Motif runs can be digitized as open or closed objects with graphical or traditional digitizing tools. Pretty much any digitizing tool can be used, including Freehand. Motif runs have some different properties to other decorative outline stitches. You can modify rotation angle, orientation and scale, and vary motif spacing.
