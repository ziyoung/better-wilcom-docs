# Apply automatic branching

The Branching feature lets you digitize like objects – e.g. the fingers of a hand, sections of a custom letter – without having to think about the most efficient stitching sequence and joins. Branching is designed for use with shapes made up of objects that overlap – e.g. complicated letters, Asian characters, etc. Apply Branching to join selected objects to form a single ‘branched object’. Objects are resequenced, [connectors](../../glossary/glossary#connectors) minimized, component objects grouped, and stitches regenerated. All component objects are grouped and selectable as one.
