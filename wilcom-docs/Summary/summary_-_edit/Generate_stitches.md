| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

With Generate Stitches on (the default), stitches are calculated for new objects whenever you press Enter. They are also updated whenever you [scale](../../glossary/glossary), transform or move the object. If speed is an issue, you can digitize objects with Generate Stitches off.
