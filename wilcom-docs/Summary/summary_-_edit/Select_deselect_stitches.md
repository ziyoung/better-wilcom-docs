# Select & deselect stitches

| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |

The Stitch Edit tool lets you select single stitches, several stitches, or a range of stitches by selecting their needle points, or dragging a [selection marquee](../../glossary/glossary) around them. You can select all stitches in a design, cancel all selections, or remove individual stitches from a selected group. Selected stitches are highlighted in a different color. You can also select individual stitches in your design using the Stitch List.
