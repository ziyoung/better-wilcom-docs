Group objects, or an entire design, to keep them together for moving, [scaling](../../glossary/glossary#scaling) and transforming actions. With grouped objects you can also apply global changes, saving time and ensuring consistency. When you have finished making changes to a group, you can ungroup and work with the component objects.

Lock objects to prevent them from being moved or modified by accident. For example, locking [backdrop](../../glossary/glossary#backdrop) images holds them in place as you digitize, transform or reshape the embroidery objects near them.
