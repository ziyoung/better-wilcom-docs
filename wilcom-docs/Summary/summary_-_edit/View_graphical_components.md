Apart from embroidery, [EMB](../../glossary/glossary) designs may include other components such as bitmap images, [vector graphics](../../glossary/glossary), appliqué fabrics, product backdrops, and rhinestones or ‘bling’. These can also be turned on or off as desired. The Options > View Graphics dialog lets you set options for viewing artwork. You can dim bitmaps as well as show/hide vector drawings.
