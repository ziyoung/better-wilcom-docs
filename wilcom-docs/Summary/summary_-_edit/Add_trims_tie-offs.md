You can add trims in your design using the Trim tool. When you add a trim in this way, the trim function is added to the current stitch. Some machines require [empty stitches](../../glossary/glossary) or [empty jumps](../../glossary/glossary) on either side of the trim. If this is the case for the machine you want to stitch to, you will need to insert them.

You can add tie-offs in your design using the Tie-Off tool. This provides a semi-automated technique for adding tie-offs as an alternative to digitizing them with manual stitches. Tie-offs are usually added before a trim at the end of an object. Generally you will follow a tie-off with a trim.

::: tip
Make sure that all stitches you trim have been tied in and off, otherwise stitches will not be secured.
