With EmbroideryStudio you can cut holes in selected closed objects with a single stitch angle using the Add Holes tool. It can only be used with objects created with the Digitize Closed Shape tool. The complementary Remove Holes tool allows you to remove unwanted holes in closed objects. Create new objects with the Fill Holes feature. This lets you fill holes formed by existing boundaries, without having to re-digitize the shape.
