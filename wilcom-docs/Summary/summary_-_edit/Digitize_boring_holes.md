If your embroidery machine is equipped with a boring knife or needle, you can use the Borers tool to cut holes in the fabric, producing an effect similar to lace. With Borers selected, each needle penetration point becomes a borer hole, regardless of the selected stitch type. Borer holes are generally stabilized with Zigzag to prevent fraying and movement, and bordered with Satin stitches.
