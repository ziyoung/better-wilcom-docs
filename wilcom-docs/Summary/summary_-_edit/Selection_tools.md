# Selection tools

Before you work with design objects, you need to select them. You can select all objects to modify the design as a whole, or individual and multiple objects for more precise modifications. The embroidery objects in a design form a stitching sequence. You can change the position of a selected object by cutting it, then pasting it somewhere else in the sequence, or using the Resequence command. You can also resequence objects by color or using the Color-Object List. The following dialogs all apply to the selection and sequencing of objects in EmbroideryStudio.
