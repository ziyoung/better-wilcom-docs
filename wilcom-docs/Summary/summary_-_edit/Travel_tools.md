It is useful to be able to view the stitching sequence color-by-color, object-by-object, or even stitch-by-stitch. The Travel toolbar provides all tools required to do so. Travel forwards or backwards with any button by right or left mouse-clicks. Traveling can be initiated from any stitch in the design. The current needle position is marked by a white cross or ‘needle position marker’. The current stitch number is displayed in the Status Bar.
