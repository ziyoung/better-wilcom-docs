# View designs

EmbroideryStudio provides many viewing modes to make it easier to work with your designs. Zoom in on an area to see more detail, view the design at actual size, or view a thumbnail of the whole design in a separate overview window. Pan the design to move it across the design window instead of scrolling, and quickly change between one view and the last. The View toolbar commands for viewing embroidery designs – e.g. as design outlines, by stitches, by machine functions, as they will stitch out on the fabric – either separately or in combination. Right-click to access settings.
