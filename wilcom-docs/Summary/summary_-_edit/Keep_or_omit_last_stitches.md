If you are digitizing adjoining columns, you can keep or omit the last stitch in the first column to achieve a smoother join or shorter connecting stitches.

::: info Note
This feature only applies when the [exit point](../../glossary/glossary#exit-point) is at the end of the column â€“ i.e. the default exit point. Moving the exit point using the Reshape Object tool overrides the Keep Last Stitch / Omit Last Stitch command.
