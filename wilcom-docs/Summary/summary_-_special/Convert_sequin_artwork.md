Frequently, artwork for sequin designs is independently created by a specialist designer and supplied to the embroidery digitizer as a vector file. The Vectors to Sequins tool is available for just this purpose. A sequin run is automatically created from a set of vector objects representing sequins. Fixing stitches are generated automatically according to current settings. If you are digitizing twin-sequin runs, EmbroideryStudio will generate sequin drops according to the currently selected sequin run pattern.
