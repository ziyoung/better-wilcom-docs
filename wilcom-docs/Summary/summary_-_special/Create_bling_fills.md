The Bling Fill feature provides a means of filling complex shapes with bling arranged in columns. Bling fill types include Column Fill (straight grid, angled grid) and Contour Fill. The fill can include a border, with or without a margin inset from the object outline. The object border can be made from different or same rhinestones and is a property of the bling-fill object.
