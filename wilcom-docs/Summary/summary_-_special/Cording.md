To create a cording design in EmbroideryStudio, simply digitize a run with Cording turned on. Any suitable input method can be used together with Run stitch. Some machines have a specific cording function which is output when saving to machine file – e.g. Barudan FDR-3 file format or Schiffli machines that support cording. For machines that don’t have an explicit cording function, the software outputs a Stop code.
