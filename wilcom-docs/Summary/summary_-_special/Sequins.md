# Sequins

Some embroidery machines are equipped with a sequin dispenser that drops sequins onto the garment as it stitches. Some are also equipped with a boring knife or needle to cut holes in the fabric, producing an effect similar to lace. Often the two techniques are used in combination. EmbroideryStudio provides a dedicated set of sequin tools which allow you to digitize sequined designs for compatible machines.
