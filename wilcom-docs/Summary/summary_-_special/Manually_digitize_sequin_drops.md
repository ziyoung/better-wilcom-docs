The Manual Sequin input method allows you individual control over sequin placement and fixing stitches. Create decorative outlines and patterns manually using sequins from the selection list. To add a sequin to the stitching sequence, simply right-click to drop it onto the design, and secure it with manual stitches. Manual sequin stitching is a difficult digitizing skill to master and you need to plan the stitching sequence carefully in order to minimize unnecessary stitches. Experiment with your machine and stitch width and spacing settings to achieve the desired result.
