EmbroideryStudio can extract outlines from a design and send them to a laser cutter. This procedure is employed when the cutter is supported directly by a MS Windows® driver. Only shapes defining the actual appliqué fabric are sent.

::: info Note
Before you send appliqué shapes to a cutter, make sure it is set up on your system with the correct MS Windows® (printer) driver. Some cutters – e.g. Ioline – use a standard driver for HP-7475 plotters. Once the driver is installed in MS Windows®, there is no need for a separate hardware setup in EmbroideryStudio.
