Flip sequins, also known as reversible sequins, create a color-changing effect which is very fashionable. Beginning with children’s wear, flip sequins have found a wide variety of applications, from reversible sequin shirts, pillow cases, bags, cases, note books, and more. Their use is simple – swipe up or down to reveal the reverse side with sometimes surprising effects. Flip sequins have also found their way into high fashion.
