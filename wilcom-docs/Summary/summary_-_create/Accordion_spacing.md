The Accordion Spacing feature varies stitch spacing between dense and open fill, producing gradient and shading effects which are difficult to achieve manually. It provides a simple way to produce variation in a filled pattern and the illusion of depth. It is best used with tatami fill. When applied, current settings – including [Auto Spacing](../../glossary/glossary) and [Fractional Spacing](../../glossary/glossary) – are ignored. However, other settings still apply, including stitch angle. Adjust settings with the Object Properties > Effects > Accordion tab.
