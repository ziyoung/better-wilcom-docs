# Graphics handling

Both bitmap images – more correctly referred to as ‘raster’ or ‘rasterized’ images – and vector images can be used in EmbroideryStudio as backdrops for digitizing. When inserted, they become ‘drawing objects’. As such, you can set general properties such as size and position, and arrange and transform them in the same way as embroidery objects. The following dialogs all apply to the use of bitmap and vector images in EmbroideryStudio.
