Stippling is a method for creating textured fills of run stitching which meanders more or less randomly within a border. It can be applied to closed objects with a single stitch angle. You control stitch density in stipple objects by adjusting stitch length and loop spacing. Stipple fill objects can be reshaped like any other complex shape object. Adjust settings with the Object Properties > Fills > Stipple Fill tab.
