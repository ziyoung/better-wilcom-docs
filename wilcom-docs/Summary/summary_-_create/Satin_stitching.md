Satin is one of those stitch types which can be used for thicker borders or for fills. It is well-suited to narrow shapes where each stitch spans the width of the column. Because there are generally no needle penetrations breaking up the fill, satin stitch gives a glossy, high-quality appearance. With Satin Raised you can also adjust the number of layers of stitching. Adjust settings with the Object Properties > Fills > Satin tab.

The Auto Spacing Settings dialog lets you specify how rapidly the spacing changes, and by how much, by changing the stitch length and spacing values.

Note: Embroidery machines have a maximum possible stitch length which is determined by the physical frame movement. If a stitch exceeds this, it is generally broken into smaller stitches of equal length. The line formed by needle penetrations can affect the appearance of the embroidery, especially satin fills. Auto Split breaks long satin stitches into shorter ones.
