While simple [run stitching](../../glossary/glossary) is typically used to add borders and pickout runs, there are stitch types for creating decorative outlines. Backstitch is an older-style, adaptable stitch which can be used for delicate outlines. Stemstitch is thicker and can be used to mimic hand-sewn embroidery. Digitize decorative outlines as you would a Run stitch outline. Adjust settings with the Object Properties > Outlines tab.
