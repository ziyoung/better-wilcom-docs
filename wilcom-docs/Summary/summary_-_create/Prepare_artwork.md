The Auto-Digitizing tools provide everything necessary to automatically digitize shapes in electronic [artwork](../../glossary/glossary) without using manual input methods. Even if your artwork looks ready to stitch when inserted into the software, however, it will need to be image-processed before conversion.

Use the Prepare Bitmap Colors tool to prepare images for automatic digitizing. This function automatically flattens colors, sharpens outlines, and reduces ‘noise’. Areas enclosed by a black outline are reduced to a single color. This makes it easier for the software to recognize distinct areas in the artwork. These areas then become the embroidery objects of the finished design.
