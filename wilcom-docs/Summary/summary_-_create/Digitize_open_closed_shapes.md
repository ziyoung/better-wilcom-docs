Use the Digitize Open Shape tool to digitize open shapes with any kind of outline stitch. Digitize Open Shape places a row of stitches along a digitized line. This tool is typically used to add borders or details to designs. Digitize free-form closed shapes with the Digitize Closed Shape tool. This tool can be used with either outline or fill stitch types.
