EmbroideryStudio lets you insert one design into another. The two (or more) designs can then be saved as a combined design. When you insert a design into another, the two [color palettes](../../glossary/glossary) are combined. Colors with the same RGB values are automatically identified as having the same thread color. If you want to preserve them as separate colors, you need to change one or other before merging.
