Remember that the Design Library is a ‘virtual library’ in Windows. When you add or remove folders from the navigation pane, this only affects the Design Library. It does not affect the folder structure on your hard drive or network. To add design folders to your library, use the Manage Embroidery Library Locations function to locate folders containing designs anywhere on your local network.
