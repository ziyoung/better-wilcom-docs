# Hoops

Devices made from wood, plastic, or steel, hoops are used to tightly grip fabric and stabilizer between an inner and outer ring. Designed to hold fabric tightly against the machine bed for embroidering, they attach to the machineâ€™s frame. Fabrics must be hooped before stitching out on the machine. EmbroideryStudio allows you to select from a wide range of standard factory-supplied hoops. If you are using a hoop which does not appear in the hoop library, you can define your own from scratch or based on a standard hoop.
