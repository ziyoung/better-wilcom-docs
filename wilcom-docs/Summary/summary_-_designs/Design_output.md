Newer machines use USB or Wired-Wireless network connections. They can appear as a disk drive or be setup to read designs from a folder on the PC. Older machines use serial ports or even proprietary embroidery disks. The Legacy Features toolbar contains functions for connecting to older styles machines.

EmbroideryStudio provides alternative means for sending designs directly to machine. Depending on your software options, you can stitch to machine using Stitch Manager, Machine Manager, or Connection Manager. Machine Manager is described in a separate Machine Manager Supplement.
