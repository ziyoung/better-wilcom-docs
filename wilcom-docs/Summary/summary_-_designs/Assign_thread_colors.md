The supplied charts represent the brands of threads that EmbroideryStudio supports. Each chart includes a range of thread colors together with code, brand and description. You can search for a thread by code or description and assign it to a selected design color slot. Alternatively, let the software match design colors to threads in the current thread chart/s.

Thread charts are lists of predefined thread colors. They may be based on commercially available thread charts, or charts you define yourself. When you create a thread chart, you are creating a store of colors for future use. You may also want to update existing thread charts by modifying thread details or removing threads.
