Design Library is a design or job order management tool. Use it to browse design and artwork files stored on your local PC or company network. Design Library capabilities make it fast and practical for daily commercial use, avoiding the need to switch to and from File Explorer. It recognizes all file formats used by EmbroideryStudio.

Design Library is installed with sample designs in [EMB](../../glossary/glossary) format. These show various stitching techniques and effects, including ‘multi-decoration’ and multiple colorways. When starting out as a new user, make sure to spend time exploring these designs.
