Navigating to design folders with Design Library is similar to browsing with File Explorer. Your access to design folders on your network is only limited by access rights determined by your [System Administrator](../../glossary/glossary). View any supported file type residing in design folders. Designs can be searched, sorted, grouped, and browsed by customer or order.
