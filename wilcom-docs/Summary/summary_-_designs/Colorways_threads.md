# Colorways & threads

When digitizing, you select thread colors for each object you create from the [color palette](../../glossary/glossary). This contains a selection of thread colors tailored for each design or color scheme. The particular ‘colorway’ represents the actual thread colors in which a design will be stitched. In fact you can define multiple color schemes and switch between them. This has important implications for sales presentations as well as production. You can also print multiple colorways, design [backgrounds](../../glossary/glossary), and icons of color blocks together with the [production worksheet](../../glossary/glossary).
