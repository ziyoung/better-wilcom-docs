The Print Selected tool lets you print worksheets for selected designs and include thumbnails of each in the worksheet. Unlike Print Designs, this option can provide design and sewing information. The Print Selected to Catalog tool allows you to print catalogs of designs with thumbnails and limited text details.

The Export Design List option can be used to print design lists for selected folders. This option allows you to create a simple design report which can easily be imported into a spreadsheet. You may want to use this in order to manage designs by file name.
