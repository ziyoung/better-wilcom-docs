The Save options allow you to save a design to native EMB format or similar 'all-in-one' format such as JAN. To save designs to other formats, choose File > Save As. EmbroideryStudio lets you save designs in various native EMB formats. This can be important if your suppliers or clients use previous versions of Wilcom software.

Warning: If a design feature is not available in the file type you select, it will be converted â€“ e.g. Flexi Split stitching may be changed to plain tatami.
