# Design reading & writing

You can open native EMB design files in EmbroideryStudio as well as many non-native design files for modifying and stitching out. When you open a design that was created or saved in another format, EmbroideryStudio changes some of the design information so that you can modify it using the full range of features. Depending on the file type, you may need to provide extra information to assist the conversion process. You can also open designs from embroidery disks, or read them from paper tape. The following dialogs all apply to the opening and conversion of designs in EmbroideryStudio.
