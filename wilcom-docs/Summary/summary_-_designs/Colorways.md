When you create a new design, it contains a single default [colorway](../../glossary/glossary) called ‘Colorway 1’. You can add a virtually unlimited number of colorways to the design using the same or different thread sets. Preview designs in different colors on different fabrics. Colorways are saved with the design in [EMB](../../glossary/glossary) format. They can also be saved to an EMT template file for use in future designs. They cannot, however, be saved with machine files.
