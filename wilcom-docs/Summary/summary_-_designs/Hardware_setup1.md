Use the Hardware Setup dialog to set up your digitizer tablets, embroidery machines and monitor in EmbroideryStudio. To set up a machine you need to define a name, the port it is attached to, and the protocol it uses. For every machine, you need to select the [machine format](../../glossary/glossary) it supports.
