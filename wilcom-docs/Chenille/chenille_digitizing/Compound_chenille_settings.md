Most chenille objects are digitized with Complex Fill in combination with Compound Chenille to create objects – even narrow ones – with built-in chain or moss borders. Some graphical tools can be used in combination with Compound Chenille, including Closed Shape, Rectangle, Ellipse, and Basic Shapes. Compound chenille objects must include a fill of Coil or Square stitching, usually with Moss stitch applying.

The Compound Chenille tool allows for up to three (1-3) offset borders, before and after. Borders can employ either moss or chain stitching, at specific offsets and needle heights.
