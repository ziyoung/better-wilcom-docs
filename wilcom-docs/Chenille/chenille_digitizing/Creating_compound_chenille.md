# Creating compound chenille

Because borders are used so frequently, chenille digitizers have to apply some thought and special techniques to their work. As much as possible, chenille designs should be planned to use Complex Fill together with Compound Chenille. The advantage of compound chenille is the tie-in/tie-off. However, other techniques are available if you intend to use Chain fills. And if your machine supports it, you can use regular embroidery for tie-offs at the end of chenille objects, as well as details and embellishments.
