# Chenille machine formats

If you select the CHENILLE template when opening a design, the machine format will default to a chenille machine. You can change machine formats at any time. Finished designs can be sent direct to a Melco chenille machine, or stitched on Tajima and Barudan chenille machines.

If your machine is different, you can customize machine format settings. For example, different models of the same machine may require different values for the same functions. You have three options:

- Modify the format for a specific design, creating a custom format to use only with that design.
- Modify one of the standard formats provided. Obviously, you would only do this if you no longer needed the original values.
- Create a new format, based on the original, and make it available to all designs.
