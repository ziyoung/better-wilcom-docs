# Borer functions

Some embroidery machines are equipped with a borer. The borer often replaces one of the needles.

Borers are often ‘knife’ attachments where the cutting position is offset 12mm from the main needle. You need to specify the needle position of the borer and its offset value.

- If your machine automatically enters an offset when a Borer In function is encountered, enter an offset of 0mm.
- If your machine requires an offset value, enter an offset of 12.0mm.
