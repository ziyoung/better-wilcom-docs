Chenille usually involves a combination of two basic fill patterns – Square and Coil, single or double. Use these stitch patterns together with Moss for chenille fills. Run stitch is typically used with Chain for borders. For chenille, you mainly use Compound Chenille with Complex Fill to digitize objects – even narrow ones – with built-in chain borders.
