# Handling chenille designs

Chenille files open in EmbroideryStudio like any other EMB design. Similarly, you save chenille designs to native EMB format or export them as machine files. They can be output to embroidery floppy disk, punched to a paper tape or sent directly to embroidery machine connected to the computer. The same file can be used by combination machines for both Chenille and Lockstitch embroidery.
