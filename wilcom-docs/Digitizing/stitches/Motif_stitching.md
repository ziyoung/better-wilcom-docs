Motifs are predefined design elements, such as hearts, leaves or border patterns. They generally consist of one or more simple objects, and are stored in a special motif set. Motifs can be used for ornamental outlines and patterned fills. Use the ones provided with the software or create your own. Motifs can be scaled, rotated and mirrored in the same way as other objects. You can even use them to create interesting three dimensional effects.
