Tatami stitch density is determined by the distance between each row of stitches. Sometimes row spacing is increased to create more open stitching for backgrounds and special effects.

::: tip
When you increase stitch spacing, Auto Underlay should be turned off. If too open, you may also find that [travel runs](../../glossary/glossary#travel-runs) and overlapping segments spoil the effect. The Trapunto effect automatically moves underlying travel runs to the edges of an object so that they can’t be seen.

## To set tatami density...

1. Select the digitizing method you want to use – e.g. Complex Turning.

2. Select Tatami and create an [embroidery object](../../glossary/glossary). Alternatively, select an existing embroidery object and click Tatami.
