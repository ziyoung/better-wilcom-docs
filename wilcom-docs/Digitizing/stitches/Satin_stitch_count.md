![SatinStitchCountSample.png](assets/SatinStitchCountSample.png)Satin Raised is often used for folk designs to mimic handmade embroidery that uses thicker thread. If you require thicker stitches, set the satin stitch to repeat itself multiple times. Use Satin Raised to create raised surfaces consisting of multiple layers of satin stitching. This can also be applied successfully to some styles of font for a raised embroidery surface.
