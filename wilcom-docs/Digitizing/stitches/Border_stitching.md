The Stitch Types toolbars include Zigzag, E Stitch, and Square. All can be used to create borders around [appliqués](../../glossary/glossary) and other embroidery objects. They can also be used for decorative effects or open fills where fewer stitches are required. Zigzag and double zigzag stitches are also frequently used as underlays.
