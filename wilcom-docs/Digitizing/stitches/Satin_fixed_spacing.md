In EmbroideryStudio, the Auto Spacing option is turned on by default. Sometimes, however, you may want to control the exact spacing of satin columns. Fixed spacing is sometimes used, for example, for decorative effects – e.g. very open spacing over, say, a tatami background. These effects cannot be achieved with Auto Spacing.

Tip: If you are using a digitizing tablet, you can quickly switch between preset styles with different spacing settings. Each button on the puck accesses the next preset style. For example, clicking button 1 accesses &lt;PRESET_SATIN_1&gt;.

## To apply satin stitch with fixed spacing...

1Select the digitizing method you want to use – e.g. [Column C](../../glossary/glossary).

2Select Satin and create an [embroidery object](../../glossary/glossary). Alternatively, select an existing embroidery object and click Satin.
