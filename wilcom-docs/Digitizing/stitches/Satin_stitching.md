# Satin stitching

Satin is one of those stitch types which can be used for thicker borders or for fills. It is well-suited to narrow shapes where each stitch spans the width of the column. Because there are generally no needle penetrations breaking up the fill, satin stitch gives a glossy, high-quality appearance.
