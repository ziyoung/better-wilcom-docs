# Curved stitching

EmbroideryStudio provides a variety of stitch types and techniques for creating curved stitching effects. These follow the contours of a shape and can be used to give a sense of depth and movement to your stitching. Some can be used with borders as well as fills.

| ![ContourFill.png](assets/ContourFill.png)           | Contour             | Stitches follow the contours of a shape, creating a contoured, light and shade effect.                             |
| ![Offset.png](assets/Offset.png)                     | Offset              | Similar to Contour in following the contours of a shape. It can be used in combination with turning stitches.      |
| ![SpiralFill.png](assets/SpiralFill.png)             | Spiral Fill         | Works best with simple shapes without holes or islands. Use it with either fixed or variable length run stitching. |
| ![RadialFill.png](assets/RadialFill.png)             | Radial Fill         | Generates radial turning stitching in several stitch types such as Satin, Tatami and Program Split.                |
| ![FlexiSplit.png](assets/FlexiSplit.png)             | Flexi Split         | Decorative effect where one or more lines of a program split pattern are molded to the object shape.               |
| ![FlorentineEffect.png](assets/FlorentineEffect.png) | Florentine / Liquid | Create interesting curved effects by getting needle penetrations to follow the contour of digitized lines.         |
