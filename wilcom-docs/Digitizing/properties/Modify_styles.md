# Modify styles

The Setup > Manage Styles function allows you to modify [styles](../../glossary/glossary#styles), including the factory presets in the NORMAL [template](../../glossary/glossary). You can merge settings from one style to another. You can rename a style without affecting its settings. You can also remove any unwanted styles from a template.
