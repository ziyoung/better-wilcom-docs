# Define styles

Define new [styles](../../glossary/glossary#styles) for a [design template](../../glossary/glossary#design-template), either from scratch or based on an existing style or object. New styles are saved to the current template.

## To define a style...

1. To base the new style on an existing object, select it now. To base it on current settings, make sure no objects are selected.

2. Select Setup > Manage Styles.

5. If you want the new style to be added to the Style toolbar, tick the Favorites checkbox.
