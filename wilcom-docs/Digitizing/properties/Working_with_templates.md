# Working with templates

Templates are special files used to store [fabrics](../../glossary/glossary), [styles](../../glossary/glossary) and default settings. Use templates when digitizing frequently-used design types so that you do not have to set the [current settings](../../glossary/glossary) every time. For example, a template may include standard objects and sample lettering. It may simply have preferred stitch settings, lettering font and size, and colors set as current settings. Or it may have special density, [pull compensation](../../glossary/glossary) or underlay settings to suit different [fabrics](../../glossary/glossary).

## The NORMAL template

The NORMAL template is the default template supplied with the software. It contains current property settings as well as a selection of preset styles. These styles include variations on the current property settings. For example, &lt;PRESET_SATIN_1&gt; and &lt;PRESET_SATIN_2&gt; contains different stitch spacing settings for Satin stitches. You can view and modify the settings for these styles at any time. [See Modify styles for details.](Modify_styles)

Note: If necessary, you can revert to the original NORMAL template after modifying it. [See Revert to the NORMAL template for details.](Revert_to_the_NORMAL_template)

## Using design templates

When you start a new design from the File > New menu, a list of the available [templates](../../glossary/glossary) appears in the New dialog. If you select the New tool on the Standard toolbar, the NORMAL template is applied by default. [See Create designs from templates for details.](../../Basics/basics/Create_designs_from_templates)
