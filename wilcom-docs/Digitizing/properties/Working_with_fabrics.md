# Working with fabrics

Embroidery stitches pull fabric inward where the needle penetrates. This can cause fabric to pucker and gaps to appear. For an object to sew out correctly, it must have correct [stitch spacing](../../glossary/glossary#stitch-spacing), sufficient [pull compensation](../../glossary/glossary#pull-compensation) together with a suitable underlay for the combination of cover stitch type, object type, object shape and fabric.

EmbroideryStudio provides a set of customized [fabric settings](../../glossary/glossary#fabric-settings) so the software will take into account the type of fabric you are stitching on. Fabrics are a critical element of designs and are controlled separately from [template](../../glossary/glossary) values. Fabric settings are fewer in number than those contained in templates.
