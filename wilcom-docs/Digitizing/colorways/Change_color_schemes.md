The color tools allow you to quickly re-color entire designs. Their main purpose is to create new ‘[colorways](../../glossary/glossary)’ quickly and easily in order to ‘spice up’ old designs or place them on a different fabric.

## To change color schemes...

- Optionally, add a new colorway for your new color scheme. [See Add colorways for details.](Add_colorways)

- Use the Cycle Used Colors tool to try out different combinations using threads already in the design.

- Alternatively, select Color Wheel. This allows you to cycle through many color combinations using preset color schemes including Analogous, Complementary, Harmonious, etc.

- Click and drag the ‘base color’ node to test combinations against different background colors. You can make any color the base color by double-clicking in the palette at the top of the dialog.
- Each color node can be further individually adjusted.
