# Design thread colors

The Thread Colors tab displays the color sequence and stitch counts for each design ‘element’. Elements equate to color changes. The tab also provides thread usage estimates which may be used for costings as well as production requirements.

Data is extracted from the design file and, apart from the Element column, cannot be modified.

| Field            | Function                                                                                                                                  |

| Title            | Defaults to filename. Add a more descriptive name for easy searching. This name appears on the approval sheet or worksheet.               |
| Stitches         | Indicates total stitch count for design.                                                                                                  |
| Colors           | Indicates number of thread colors involved in the design.                                                                                 |
| Colorways        | Number of colorways in the design.                                                                                                        |
| Current colorway | Use the droplist to change colorways, if available. When choosing a different colorway, the thumbnail and stop sequence list are updated. |

| Stitches  | There is a stitch count for each element in the design. You can show this as a discrete stitch count or a cumulative stitch count.                                    |
| Length    | Meterage of thread required per color.                                                                                                                                |
