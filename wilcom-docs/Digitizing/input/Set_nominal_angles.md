::: info Note
The ‘nominal angle’ in a Complex Turning object only takes effect if multiple stitch angles are irreconcilable – it then reverts to parallel stitching in the direction of the nominal angle. The nominal angle also affects certain underlay styles.

::: tip
You can adjust stitch angles of free-form objects interactively using the Stitch Angles tool.
