# Generate stitches

| ![GenerateStitches.png](assets/GenerateStitches.png) | Use Stitch > Generate Stitches to generate stitches for selected objects. |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

With Generate Stitches on (the default), stitches are calculated for new objects whenever you press Enter. They are also updated whenever you [scale](../../glossary/glossary), transform or move the object. If speed is an issue, you can digitize objects with Generate Stitches off.

## To generate stitches...

- To generate stitches for new or selected objects, select Stitch > Generate Stitches or press G.
