# Digitizing with graphical tools

The graphics approach to digitizing is similar to CorelDRAW® Graphics Suite or other graphics applications. Assign a stitch type to shapes from the Stitch Types toolbars. Graphics digitizing tools are set to default values. To adjust the resulting objects, use the stitch angle, reshape, and hole tools.

::: info Note
The Graphics Digitizing toolbar also contains ‘freehand’ tools to create ‘drawing’ embroidery outlines and fills directly on screen. [See Freehand embroidery for details.](../../Decorative/specialty/Freehand_embroidery)
