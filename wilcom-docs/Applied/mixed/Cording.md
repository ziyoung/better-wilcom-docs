# Cording

Cording refers to the technique of fixing a thick cord or yarn onto a fabric, usually for decorative purposes. Digitizers frequently want to see the cord line so that while they digitize, they donâ€™t overstitch on sharp turns. The Cording function allows you to designate the run stitching which is to form the cording.
