# Boring

Borer embroidery remains a popular technique for cutting holes in fabric to produce an effect similar to lace. If your embroidery machine is equipped with a boring knife or needle, the Borers function is available to turn needle penetrations into boring holes, regardless of selected stitch type. Holes are cut in the fabric, producing an effect similar to lace.
