You have complete control over scaling and reshaping sequin-run objects. You can also manually fine-tune sequin spacings as well as remove or add individual sequins. You can even edit individual fixing stitches.

::: info Note
Performing manual edits to sequin-run objects automatically deselects all options. If you reset to Exact, Contract to fit, or Expand to fit, all manual edits are lost and sequin drops recalculated.

## To edit a sequin run...

- Scale sequin-run objects by clicking and dragging selection handles, or by adjusting general properties.
- If the object is created with the Sequin Run Auto tool, the sequin drops are automatically recalculated.
