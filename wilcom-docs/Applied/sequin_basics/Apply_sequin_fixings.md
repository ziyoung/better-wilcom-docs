You can select sequins before or after digitizing. Similarly, you can preset fixing stitches or change them at any stage.

::: tip
Digitizers sometimes want to generate a sequin run and overlay it with a plain run so that sequins are more securely fixed. Another reason for backtracking is to avoid jump stitches between objects. The Backtrack/Repeat tool is enabled for sequin-run objects. When applied, EmbroideryStudio generates manual stitches but leaves other functions unaffected.

- To adjust fixing stitch size, select a method:

| Method       | Function                                                                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Match sequin | Automatically sets a margin around the sequin so that fixing stitches don’t punch too close. |
| Set manually | Enables the Size field and lets you set a fixing stitch size independent of sequin size.     |

- If you choose the manual option, specify a value in the Size field. Size is measured from the center of the sequin. Enter a value from 2.50mm to 30.00mm.

- If you have chosen automatic matching, specify a margin for the fixing stitch in the Margin field. Enter a value from 0.20mm to 2.00mm. This ensures that the fixing stitch does not punch too close to the sequin.
- If you have chosen an eccentric sequin shape such as ‘ellipse’, fixing stitches automatically adapt to fit.
