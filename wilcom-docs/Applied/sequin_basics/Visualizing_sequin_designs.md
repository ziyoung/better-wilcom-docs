When traveling through a sequin design, ‘undropped’ sequins appear in the ‘unsewn’ color defined in the Background & Display Colors dialog.

Tip: The Show Repeats function displays repeating designs, including sequins, in both TrueView and stitch view. You can view a design, even while digitizing, with any number of repeats.
