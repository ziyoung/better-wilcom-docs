With EmbroideryStudio, you can create bead run patterns for immediate use. Patterns generally involve multi-bead drops.

## To create a patterned bead run...

- Create a bead-run object with Bead Run Auto or select an existing object. This allows you to preview your pattern as you go.

- Add or remove beads via the + and X buttons in the column header.
- Select a bead from the droplist. The selected sample updates immediately.
- In the Spacing field, enter a nominal spacing for each bead. By default, spacing is measured along the digitized line.
