You have complete control over editing bead-run objects, from scaling to adding or removing individual beads. You can also manually fine-tune bead spacing and orienation. You can even edit individual fixing stitches.

::: tip
Performing manual edits automatically sets bead positioning to Manual. If you reset to Exact, Contract to fit, or Expand to fit, all manual edits are lost.
