You can create appliqué objects with partial cover stitching without doubling-up borders with Partial Appliqué. In combination with the Remove Overlaps tool, you can remove all underlying stitching.

## To create partial cover appliqué...

- Digitize appliqué shapes with Appliqué.

- If you only want to remove underlying cover stitching, select both objects and click Partial Appliqué. Cover stitches are generated in a clockwise direction between start and end points, leaving the rest of the boundary unstitched.

- If you want to remove all underlying stitching, first select the ‘cutter’ object and select Arrange > Remove Overlaps or right-click the tool.
