# Outputting appliqué

Print a copy of appliqué patterns to use in cutting out fabric pieces. Alternatively, use Send to Appliqué Cutter to send [appliqué](../../glossary/glossary#applique) shapes from a design file to a laser cutter.

::: tip
CorelDRAW Graphics also lets you output objects as a vector file. This can then be downloaded to a laser cutter using CorelDRAW® Graphics Suite. For a full description of the CorelDRAW® Graphics Suite tools, refer to the electronic User Guide available via the MS Windows® Start > Programs group. Alternatively, use the onscreen help available from the Help menu.
