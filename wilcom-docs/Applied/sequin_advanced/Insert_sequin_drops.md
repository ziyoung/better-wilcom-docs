In preference to the Manual Sequin tool, some digitizers flesh out designs using Run or Triple Run or even Motif Run and then travel through it, dropping sequins manually as and where required. The running stitch itself works as fixing stitch. It can be reinforced with Backtrack. This technique can be used with single or multi-sequins.
