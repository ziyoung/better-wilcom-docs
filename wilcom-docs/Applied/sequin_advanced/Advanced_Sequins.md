# Advanced Sequins

Some embroidery machines are equipped with devices that can drop sequins onto the garment as it stitches. Machine capabilities vary widely. Some machines only support single-sequin devices. Some machines support twin-sequin devices. Newer machines can support multi-sequin devices. These may perform consecutive sequin feeds – one at a time whilst stitching. Some may allow ‘stack feeding’, where multiple sequins are dropped and secured with a single fixing stitch.
