Flip sequins, also known as reversible sequins, create a color-changing effect which is very fashionable. Beginning with children’s wear, flip sequins have found a wide variety of applications, from reversible sequin shirts, pillow cases, bags, cases, note books, and more. Their use is simple – swipe up or down to reveal the reverse side with sometimes surprising effects. Flip sequins have also found their way into high fashion.

Sequin Fill can be used in combination with Carving Stamp to digitize twin-sequin fills with predefined twin sequin assignments. The stamp pattern takes the color of the other sequin in the currently selected pair. Use the Reshape tool to size, rotate and reshape stamp patterns.
