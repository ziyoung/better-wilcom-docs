In some production environments, each file is placed in a specific location where it can be used by the operator of that process. For example, the Tajima Machine Network requires all files to be placed in a specific folder so they can be seen directly by the machine. Similarly, file formats used in any given process do not change unless the process changes – for example, if a machine is replaced. Use the following procedure when you want to set export defaults for the Export Multi-Decoration Files process.

## To set export locations...

1Run the Export Multi-Decoration Files procedure.

3Select file locations via the browse (...) button for each design component.

4Click OK to finish.

Once set, your settings are remembered for each successive session.

Tip: Preset locations can be overridden for one-off exports – e.g. to USB stick – by means of the Export to option.
