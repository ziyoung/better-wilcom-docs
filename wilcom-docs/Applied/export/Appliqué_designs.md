# Appliqué designs

Appliqué is a decoration or ornament made from cut pieces of one material applied to the surface of another. Pieces may be fixed to one another using an embroidered border of satin, raised satin, or none. Appliqué cutting is supported in EmbroideryStudio by outputting vectors that describe the appliqué material. The information can be sent directly to a supported MS Windows® cutter or output to printed templates for manual cutting of appliqué shapes.
