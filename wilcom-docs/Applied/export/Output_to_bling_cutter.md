7. Click OK to send the bling templates to bling cutter or to file.

The bling cutting/engraving information is sent to machine in the required format. The machine cuts the desired template/s. The cutting data consists solely of vectors which describe the location, size, and shape of the bling in the template. There are no connecting lines or data that do not relate directly to bling placement.

Tip: A bling production summary shows stone colors, sizes, and quantities as well as a summary on the first page.
