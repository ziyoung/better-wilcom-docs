On occasion, you may want to export only selected objects from your multi-decoration design. The Export Multi-Decoration Files capability allows you to pre-select objects in the design window.

## To export selected objects...

1. Open or create a multi-decoration design.

2. Select the individual objects you want to export. In the example below, we will export the word ‘Cheerleading’ only.

5. Make location adjustments as necessary and click Export. Only selected objects are exported to file.
