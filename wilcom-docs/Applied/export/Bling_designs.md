# Bling designs

Bling, rhinestones, crystals, and glitz are interchangeable terms referring to decorative objects placed on garments or templates. They are supplied in various sizes, shapes, colors and materials. There are two basic processes for creating bling designs:

- Hot-fix template production
- Direct-to-garment production

## Hot-fix template production

Hot-fix templates can be produced in two ways:

- Bling template: This is the design layout on which rhinestones are initially placed prior to transfer. The template is created by cutters or engravers. Rhinestones are placed onto the template by a manual flood-fill process and then manually transferred to transfer tape.
- Bling transfer: In a semi-automatic process, bling is placed directly onto transfer tape (or sheet) by machine. Examples are IOline CrystalPress and CAMS machines. The bling design is ready for heat transfer to the final product â€“ e.g. a T-shirt.

## Direct-to-garment bling production

Direct-to-garment bling production is supported by many machines. Automatic rhinestone transfer machines are designed for high speed, high volume production. They enable users to fix any type of rhinestones, studs, and so forth directly to any type of fabric.

Tip: If you have neither CAMS automatic rhinestone placement machine nor a direct-connect cutting machine, you can use the Convert Bling for Production command to convert bling objects to vector shapes. These can be then output to vector file for use by third-party applications. [See Outputting bling for details.](../bling/Outputting_bling)
