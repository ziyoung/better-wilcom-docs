# Exporting multiple decoration files

EmbroideryStudio allows all multi-decoration components to be exported as file formats suitable for the particular process or machine. Apart from embroidery, EmbroideryStudio supports design output for a number of related and sometimes complementary decoration processes. Namely, bling (rhinestone) designs, printed designs, as well as appliqué designs.
