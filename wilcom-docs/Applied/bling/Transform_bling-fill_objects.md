Bling-fill objects can be scaled and transformed like any embroidery object with one difference. Bling-fill objects exist in one of two ‘layout’ states: Auto and Manual. In the Auto state, bling fills are automatically re-generated whenever an object is scaled or reshaped. In the Manual state, the bling count does not change during transformations.

## To transform a bling-fill object...

- Select the bling-fill object and check the Layout setting.
