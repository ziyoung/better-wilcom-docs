# Modifying bling objects

Bling-fill objects can be scaled and reshaped like any embroidery object. When reshaping, resizing or editing an object/design, the software automatically recalculates the number of stones but does not resize them. The Bling toolset also provides tools for editing rhinestones individually.

::: tip
Object properties for bling-run and bling-fill objects can be copied and applied to other objects. This is done via the Make Properties Current and Apply Current Properties commands.
