# Bling Digitizing

Bling refers to decorative objects placed on garments or templates, either on their own or in combination with other design elements. Bling is supplied in varying sizes, shapes, colors and materials. It goes under names such as diamante, rhinestones, eyelets, ribbons, charms, crystals, glitz, nailheads, studs, etc. EmbroideryStudio lets you add bling to multi-decoration designs with the Bling toolset. This allows you to create and visualize bling embellishments in combination with other decorative elements.
