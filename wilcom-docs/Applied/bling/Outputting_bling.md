EmbroideryStudio supports a number of methods for exporting bling for production. Options include:

| Output method  | Details                                                                                       |

| CAMS machine   | If you have a CAMS automatic rhinestone placement machine, use the dedicated CAMS connection. |
| Placement file | Alternatively, export your bling design to YNG format to be read by your placement machine.   |
| Bling cutter   | Send bling shapes direct to any supported cutting machine.                                    |
| Vector file    | Convert bling shapes to vectors in order to cut bling templates.                              |

The Export Multi-Decoration Files capability allows you to output files for multi-decoration designs. The system recognizes whether a component is embroidery, graphic, appliqu√©, or bling.
