# Add bling borders

Like sequin fills, bling fills can also include a border, with or without a margin. The border can be made from different or same rhinestones and is a property of the bling-fill object.

2Use pattern settings to create simple or variegated bling borders.

3Select the bling margin as required.

A border margin is created by adding an ‘offset’ to each individual bling item in the border. Smaller border margins result in a larger number of rhinestones in the fill as shown.
