# Glossary

## 10O

Machine file format native to Toyota machines.

## 3D Warp

3D Warp is used with Motif Fill to create three dimensional effects. You can make shapes appear concave or convex using Globe In or Globe Out. You can also create distance effects using Perspective.

## ABC Pattern Arrangements

See Pattern Arrangements (ABC).

## Accordion spacing

Artistic stitch effect that gradually varies stitch spacing between dense and open fill along an embroidery object, producing shading and color effects which are difficult to achieve manually.

## Acetate

A salt or ester of acetic acid of cellulose made into a synthetic filament, yarn, or fabric.

## Active window

The active window is one to which the next command or action will apply. If a window is ‘active’, its title bar changes color to differentiate it visually from other open windows.

## Aetze

The breaking down or dissolving of a base fabric on which a lace pattern has been stitched, leaving only the stitched threads. Or lace processing – ‘wet aetze’ involving a caustic soda bath or ‘dry aetze’ involving heat.

## Aetzing

The process of eliminating the base fabric to make Schiffli laces, leaving only the threads remaining.

## Allover

Continuous embroidery which covers all of the goods from selvage to selvage.

## Anchor point

A fixed point used when rotating, scaling, skewing or mirroring a design.

## Anti-aliasing

A software technique similar to dithering which is used to soften hard outlines where color blocks intersect. It produces smoother outlines by ‘blurring’ the pixels where colors join.

## Appliqué

Decoration or trimming cut from one piece of fabric and stitched to another to add dimension and texture. Designs with appliqué can be more economical than embroidery alone, if appliqué occupies a significant amount of the design, thereby lowering stitch count. In Schiffli embroidery, appliqué refers to an embroidered motif, hand-cut or aetzed away from base fabric.

## Appliqué cutter

A device that can cut fabric along a line, somewhat like old pen plotters. It requires a vector file as input. In MS Windows® they can be set up as a type of printer device.

## ARQ

BERNINA Quilter format.

## ART

BERNINA format.

## Artwork

Bitmap image or vector graphic used as a digitizing template. See also Bitmap image and Vector graphic.

## Artwork preparation

See Image preparation.

## Aufsatz

The last stitch of a design before it repeats itself.

## ARX

ES Cross Stitch format.

## Auto appliqué

Auto Appliqué is an embroidery object associated with an appliqué which provides automatic stitching to place it, tack it down, and cover its edges.

## Auto center

Auto Center automatically centers the start and end points of a design.

## Auto-digitizing

Toolset used to create embroidery designs by automatically digitizing blocks of color in electronic images, or converting vector outlines directly to embroidery objects. See also Smart Design.

## Auto kerning

For lettering objects, auto-kerning involves looking up in a ‘kerning table’. This specifies the spacing adjustments for each pairwise combination of letters so that whenever a predefined pair occurs, the letter spacing is automatically adjusted.

## Auto scroll

The Auto Scroll feature automatically scrolls the screen while you are digitizing.

## Auto spacing

Auto Spacing only affects Satin stitch. It adjusts stitch spacing according to column width.

## Auto split

Auto Split only affects Satin stitch. When applied, it breaks any long Satin stitches into shorter ones. It also distributes needle penetrations in a random pattern so that they do not form a line in the middle of the shape. Used primarily to prevent long stitches in wide columns, it can also be used as an alternative to Tatami fill. Auto Split looks more Satin-like and works well with turning stitches, creating soft lines and a little more depth.

## Auto start and end

Before stitching, some embroidery machines require you to position the starting needle exactly above the first needle penetration point. Use Auto Start and End to connect the first and last stitches in the design. This makes it easy to position the needle before stitching, and reduces the chance of the needle hitting the side of the frame.

## Automatic color change

Ability of multi-needle embroidery machine to follow a command to change to a specified needle with a different thread color.

## Automatic pull compensation

Embroidery stitches pull the fabric inwards where the needle penetrates. This can cause the fabric to pucker, and gaps to appear in the embroidery. Automatic pull compensation counters this effect by ‘overstitching’ outlines of filled shapes on the sides where the needle penetrates. This means the design can be optimized for different fabrics. See also Pull compensation.

## Automatic stitch shortening

Reduces stitch bunching at sharp corners. See also Stitch shortening.

## Auto Trace

Auto Trace is used to convert bitmap images to vector drawings.

## Back appliqué

A fabric piece used behind a design where the front fabric will be cut away to reveal the fabric beneath it.

## Backdrop

An electronic image used as a guide for digitizing designs on screen. Two types are used – vector or bitmap. Insert them from various file sources, or copy and paste them via the MS Windows® clipboard.

## Background

EmbroideryStudio lets you change the background color of the design workspace to match the color of your fabric. Or you can select a background fabric for more realistic previews and presentations. The background is saved with the colorway.

## Backing

Also known as ‘stabilizers’, backings are woven or non-woven materials placed beneath the item or fabric being embroidered for stability and support. A backing can be hooped with the item or placed between the machine throat plate and hooped garment. The more stitches a design has, the heavier the backing required. Backings are available in various weights and types such as cut-away, tear-away and wash-away (soluble). Professional embroiderers use tear-away stabilizers for woven fabrics and cut-away stabilizers for knits. See also Topping.

## Backstitch

Backstitch is an input method which can be used for delicate outlines. This stitch follows intricate curves well. It is also is the term used for every second row of stitches in a Tatami fill. See also Standard backstitch, Borderline backstitch, and Diagonal backstitch.

## Backtrack

Use Backtrack and Repeat to reinforce outlines while specifying the direction of the stitching. Backtrack stitches in reverse direction to the original. It is typically used to make run stitch outlines thicker without creating unwanted connecting stitches. Repeat duplicates the original stitch direction and is typically used with closed shapes.

## Backup

The copying of files onto floppy disk or other storage media in order to duplicate and secure data. Usually two copies are made and kept separately.

## Batting

A layer of padded material between the front and back fabric to add thickness and substance.

## Begin jump function

Begin Jump functions instruct the machine not to use needle penetrations. When encoded in an output file, it normally converts to a Needle In function. See also End Jump function.

## Bézier curve

Vector shape produced according to principles invented by French engineer, Pierre Bézier. A Bézier curve consists of a series of segments with shapes generated by cubic functions. Each segment is bounded by nodes, and its curvature is affected by a control point associated with the node at each end. The displacement and direction of the control point from the node are parameters from which the cubic curve shape is derived.

## Bitmap

Also known as raster images, bitmaps are electronic images made up of dots or ‘pixels’, in contrast to vector ‘outlines’. Each pixel is mapped to a location in an image and has numerical color values. Typically created in paint programs, bitmaps have file extensions such as BMP, JPG, GIF, TIF and PCX. When enlarged or scaled down, vector drawings preserve image quality while bitmap images generally cause problems of pixelation and image degradation. See also Pixels.

## Blackwork

Blackwork gets its name from the black silk thread traditionally used in this form of embroidery. It can be used to decorate articles such as hankies, table napkins, table clothes, and doilies.

## Blatt stitch

Schiffli term meaning ‘to feed the yarn’, thereby producing a long zigzag stitch with threads lying close together. Adapted for Multihead use. See also Satin stitch.

## Blending

See Color Blending.

## Bling

Refers to decorative objects placed on a garment or template. They are supplied in various sizes, shapes, colors and materials. Often referred to as rhinestones.

## Block

The basic unit of a quilt top.

## BMP

MS Windows® bitmap image format. See also Bitmap.

## Bobbin

Spool or reel that holds the bobbin thread, which helps form stitches on the underside of the fabric.

## Bobbin thread length

This factor provides a simple mechanism for a more accurate bobbin thread length estimate. The default value (100%) is suitable for a design with a mixture of stitch types. If the design is all run stitches or all tatami, more bobbin thread will be used and the factor can be increased say to 125%. If the design is all satin stitch, the factor can be reduced to say 65%.

## Bonding

Permanently joining two fabrics together with a bonding agent. Heat sealing.

## Border

Single closed-curve object which can be optionally added to a monogram. Also, a strip of fabric that is joined to an inner quilt to enhance it.

## Borderline backstitch

The rows are approximately parallel. With lower density fills, borderline backstitch creates a smooth, well-defined edge. Borderline backstitch is also called Trapunto style. See also Backstitch.

## Borer

Borer is a sharp instrument attached to embroidery machines to puncture fabrics. Schiffli machines have built-in borer knives under the needle line which can cut different sized holes in fabric.

## Borer depth

You can choose the numbering system for specifying Borer depth – Plauen where one is the base and seven (7) the normal middle position and Saurer where the base is zero and the normal middle position is six (6).

## Borer depth function

The Borer Depth function controls the size of the boring hole. The deeper the borer cuts, the larger the hole. The borer depth on Schiffli machines is changed one value at a time. Thus a change in depth of three (3) units will be automatically distributed by Schiffli to three (3) stitches.

## Borer functions

Borer In/Out functions are available for embroidery machines equipped with a borer. They instruct the machine when to use the boring knife or tool instead of a needle.

## Boring

‘Open-work’ incorporated into embroidered designs. A sharp-pointed instrument punctures, or bores, the fabric, and stitches are made around the opening to enclose the raw edges.

## Boring tension functions

Start/End Boring Tension functions instruct servo thread machines to feed less thread for stitching in boring holes. For Hiraoka TNS Ein, it overrides/restores Stepp/Blatt tension.

## Bounding box

The dotted rectangle that appears when you select a range of items.

## Branching

The Branching feature lets you digitize like objects – e.g. the fingers of a hand – without having to think about the most efficient stitching sequence and joins.

## BRO

## Center run underlay

Center Run underlay places a row of stitches along the center of a column. It is used to stabilize narrow columns (e.g. 2-3 mm wide).

## Chain stitch

Stitch that resembles a chain link, formed with one thread fed from the bottom side of the fabric. Done on a manual or computerized machine with a hook that functions like a needle.

## Checkbox

A small square box that appears in a dialog box and that can be selected or cleared. When selected, a tick or a cross appears. A checkbox represents an option that you can set.

## Chenille

Used to close a window or an application. In MS Windows®, it appears as a small box with an ‘X’ in it at the top-right of the title bar.

## CND

Melco Condensed (CND) is the native file format of the Melco embroidery digitizing software. CND files store only digitized outlines and stitch values.

## Color blending

Digitizing technique which creates interesting perspective, shading and color effects by blending colored layers. Two colors are merged smoothly from one to another using a mixture of dense and open fill.

## Color block

A color block or ‘element’ corresponds to a color change in the design. It may be comprised of one or more same-color objects. These may form a single group – e.g. ‘ropes’ – or more – e.g. ‘ropes and birds’. Each color block, or element, can be given a descriptive name for easy identification. These then appear on the production worksheet. The operator generally uses them to ensure correct colors are used during production. The Color-Object List provides a sequential list of objects as digitized, grouped by ‘color block’. This list shows a separate icon for all color blocks and objects used in the design. The Color Palette Editor also shows a list of color blocks.

## Color-change function

Color-change functions tell the Schiffli machine to change thread color. In RCC/INC machines, the command also moves the frame under the next selected needle. They are automatically inserted when you select a new color from the color palette.

## Color depth

Color depth, also called ‘pixel depth’, refers to the amount of color information available to each pixel in an image. An image with a color depth of 1-bit can display only two colors. As the color depth increases, more colors are available – 16 Colors (4 bit), 256 Colors (8 bit), High Color (16 bit), True Color (24 bit).

## Color palette

The color palette contains a selection of thread colors tailored for each design. This color scheme, or ‘colorway’, represents the actual thread colors in which a design will be stitched. See also Thread chart.

## Color Reduction

See Image Preparation.

## Colorways

Colorways are multiple color schemes for the same design. They are made up of colors defined in ‘color blocks’ which may be created in EmbroideryStudio or similar design program, or may be selected from a patent color system such as Chromatone or Pantone.

## Column

Narrow, long, curving shape.

## Column A

An input method used to digitize columns of varying width and stitch angle. Digitized pairs of reference points define the outline, while lines connecting the pairs define the stitch angles.

## Column B

An input method used to digitize shapes where one side is different to the other, especially where one side requires more reference points than the other. Stitches turn evenly throughout the entire shape. You can use any fill stitch type except Motif Fill.

## Column C

An input method used to digitize columns of fixed width. It is typically used for digitizing borders and outlines of larger shapes. You can digitize columns to create thick lines or borders. Column C is typically used with Satin stitch.

## COM port

A standard serial port used as a connection point for peripherals. Other ports may be present if the appropriate internal option cards have been installed. The computer must be informed which port is being used by which peripheral – e.g. COM1, COM2, etc.

## Combination Split

Use of different combinations of Satin and Tatami stitches in Program Split to create various effects with the same pattern. There are three Combination Split options – Satin in Satin, Satin in Tatami and Tatami in Tatami.

## Command

An instruction issued to the software in order to carry out an action. It may be as simple as ‘paste an object’ or as complex as ‘regenerate stitches’. It is usually activated via a menu item, toolbar icon, or command button in a dialog.

## Command button

A button in a dialog which executes or cancels the selected action. Two common command buttons are Cancel and OK.

## Complex Fill

Input method, used to digitize large and complex shapes. Allows holes to be designated at the same time the object outline is digitized. The object is thus digitized as one fill area, instead of being broken down into multiple sections. Objects so created are known as Complex Fill objects.

## Complex Turning

This is an input method used to digitize complex shapes with turning stitches. Many shapes can be digitized with this tool. Create objects using left and right clicks to mark reference points to form the boundary outlines. By digitizing boundaries within shapes, you can create filled objects with holes.

## Condensed file

See Design file.

## Configuration

The size and type of computer hardware. Can also be used to mean the options provided with your software.

## Confirmation message

A message displayed by the software asking you if you are sure you want to proceed – e.g. when you want to delete a design.

## Connection Manager

A software feature to allow the sending of files to shared folders.

## Connector stitches

Connector stitches link objects in a design. They can be run stitches or jumps. You can use automatic settings to generate connectors, trims and tie-offs, or add them manually. However, automatic connectors are not recommended for Schiffli designs because machine functions cannot be placed on connector stitches (stitches in the Needle Out position).

## Connectors

Hardware devices to connect cables to ports. If the connection is male, the port is female, and vice versa. The wiring configuration of each device is determined by its function.

## Copy

To place a copy of a selection onto the clipboard. See also Duplicate.

## Control panel

The panel on an embroidery machine by which the operator sets up the machine for embroidery production.

## Control points

Control points are used to modify object shapes, stitch angles and entry and exit points. You can change the shape of an object by moving, adding or deleting control points on the outline. For most objects, you can also change control points from corner points to curves.

## Contour stitch

Contour is a curved fill stitch type – stitches follow the contours of a shape, creating a curved, light and shade effect. It only works on columnar shapes. There are two types – Standard and Spiral – both of which can be applied to Column A, Column B, Column C or Ring objects. Standard Contour can also be applied to Circle objects.

## Copyright

A right granted by the government or by international agreement giving the owner the exclusive privilege to publish and sell artistic work during the life of the creator plus 50 years.

## Cord functions

Cord In/Out functions tell the machine to engage or disengage the cord device.

## Cording

Cording is a technique which employs a single decorative cord laid on fabric and attached with transparent zigzag stitches. It forms relatively simple, low-stitch-count designs featuring lots of swirls and curves. Raised cording is achieved by sewing the garment around the cord from the wrong side. The result is a self-fabric raised effect. Different widths of cording are available to provide a wide range of looks. A special attachment is required for the embroidery machine.

## Cord-in-lay

A special apparatus to automatically lay on cord or ribbons on a Schiffli machine.

## Cover stitch

Cover stitch is the border around an appliqué shape. You can control various settings including cover stitch type – Satin or E Stitch – width, stitch spacing, as well as the offset.

## Conversion software

Programs that read information, other than from a card, and translate it from one sewing machine format to another.

## Converter box

A converter box acts like a translator from one memory card format to another, via computer. Various companies offer this technology under names like the Magic Box™ from Oklahoma Embroidery. They translate designs from memory cards in other formats or from a hard drive, disk, or CD and write the design to a blank card.

## Crest

An embroidered motif like an emblem, an insignia or a Coat of Arms.

## Crystals

See Bling.

## CPU

Central Processing Unit.

## CSD

POEM/Singer/Huskygram file format

## Current settings

Current property settings override the template defaults. Unless you deliberately change them, these take the default values. You generally change them to save time when digitizing. For example, you may preset Tatami stitch spacing to use a specific density for all new Tatami objects you create. See also Object properties.

## Custom

## Design elements

The decorative design components that make up a monogram (including ornaments and borders).

## Design file

Design files, also known as ‘all-in-one’ or ‘outline’ files, are high-level formats which contain object outlines, object properties and stitch data. Examples include CND, GNC, INP and PCH. When you open a design file in EmbroideryStudio, corresponding stitch types, input methods and effects are applied. Design files can be scaled, transformed and reshaped without affecting stitch density or quality. See also Machine file.

## Design object

See Objects.

## Design information

Designs themselves have properties, some of which can be modified, others not. The most important design property is its source – Native Design, Imported Outlines, Processed Stitches, or Imported Stitches. Other properties include the software version number, stitch count, and so on. Colorways too are properties of the whole design.

## Design repeat

A Schiffli design is repeated horizontally as many times as it fits across the frame. Repeat values increment in multiples of 4 to a maximum of 96\. For example, the design can be stitched by every needle (Repeat=4/4), every second needle (Repeat=8/4), or every third needle (Repeat=12/4), and so on.

## Design source

While embroidery files are broadly classified as ‘design’ (outline) or ‘machine’ (stitch), EmbroideryStudio internally tags files as belonging to one of four types–Native Design, Imported Outlines, Processed Stitches, or Imported Stitches. See also Design information.

## Design template

See Template.

## Design Workspace

The design workspace is where designs are displayed for viewing and modification.

## DW Administrator

It is the DW Administrator who is generally responsible for the high-level setup of DesignWorkflow databases. The DW Administrator determines who gets access to databases, what users can see and do, and who defines the categories under which information will be stored. The DW Administrator is generally the manager of the company’s design section. This person has the necessary background knowledge and authority to control what goes into databases and how the information is to be used.

The backward rows are diagonal, directly connecting the forward rows. Diagonal backstitch is suitable for turning shapes, and gives good results with Jagged Edge. See also Backstitch.

## Dialog

An onscreen box that either requests or provides information. Many dialogs present options to choose among before a command is carried out. Some dialogs present warnings or explain why a command cannot be completed.

## Digitizer

Usually refers to the person punching or digitizing the design. Digitizer can also refer to the digitizing tablet used by the digitizer. See also Digitizing tablet.

## Digitizing

Process of encoding a design. Artwork is converted into a series of ‘embroidery objects’ to be read and manipulated by a specialist CAD/CAM application. Before outputting to embroidery machine, it is converted into ‘stitch data’. See also Punching.

## Digitizing puck

With a digitizing tablet, you generally use a puck instead of a mouse to mark reference points and select commands from the menu chart.

## Digitizing tablet

Design device used by digitizers to plot needle penetrations for embroidery designs. Sometimes used as an alternative to digitizing directly on-screen. Typically, a pencil drawing of the design is enlarged and then taped to this tablet. The digitizer then uses a device known as a puck to indicate stitch types, shapes, underlay and actual needle penetrations.

## Digitizing tool

Digitizing tools, sometimes referred to as ‘input methods’, are similar to drawing tools except that the end result is an embroidery object rather than a vector object. Different digitizing tools are suited to creating different shapes or design elements.

## Direct-to-garment printing

DTG is performed like most other printing from a PC. The print ima ge is sent to the DTG printer through the MS Windows® print manager using a print driver. The image must have a transparent background for DTG printing. DTG printing requires heat fixing to make the images washable.

## Disk

See Floppy disk.

## Disk drive

Computers usually have three types of disk drive: a hard disk (or fixed disk) which usually supports the mass storage of information and applications, a floppy disk drive, and a CD ROM drive.

## Display

A screen used to display the output of a computer. Also known as the monitor.

## Dithering

A software technique which combines existing colors in a checkerboard arrangement of pixels. It is typically used to simulate colors that are missing from an image palette. A type of optical illusion created by placing two pixels of different color next to each other. The human eye automatically resolves the two colors into a third color.

## Docker

A dialog which, while open, allows the user to select objects freely. Controls in the dialog change to conform to the values of selected objects, or show relevant system information when no object is selected. Changes made to settings in the dialog may be applied while it remains open. Other dialogs and commands may be opened and used while the modeless dialog remains open.

## Drop sequin function

The Drop Sequin function is available for embroidery machines equipped with a sequin dispenser. It instructs the machine when to drop a sequin on the fabric for stitching.

## DSB

Barudan file format. Basically the same as the T03 tape file but wit a ‘header’ in front so that it can be written to floppy disk – i.e. it is the floppy disk version of the T03 file.

## DST

Machine file format native to Tajima machines.

## DSZ

ZSK stitch or ‘expanded’ file format.

## Duplicate

When an object is duplicated, it is not copied to the clipboard. This leaves the clipboard free for you to cut or copy other objects.

## DXF

AutoCAD vector graphic format.

## E Stitch

Widely used for tacking down appliqués as a decorative border. The stitches form a comb pattern.

## Editing

Changing aspects of a design via a computerized editing program. Most programs allow you to scale designs up or down, edit stitch-by-stitch or block-by-block, merge lettering with the design, move aspects of the design around, combine designs and insert or edit machine commands.

## Elastic lettering

Special effects applied to lettering objects to make them bulge, stretch or compress.

## Electronic artwork

There are two broad categories of artwork file, both of which can be imported into EmbroideryStudio for use as digitizing backdrops – vector and bitmap. To create good quality embroidery, you need to choose or create suitable artwork of either format.

## Element

An element, in software terms, is a color block consisting of sequential, same-color objects. You can assign names to elements which then appear on the production worksheet. The operator generally uses these to make sure colors are correct during production. See also Production worksheet.

## EMB

Design file format native to Wilcom ES. EMB designs contain a complete set of design information in a single ‘all-in-one’ file – object outlines and properties, actual stitches and machine functions, thread colors, a picture icon, summary information, and more. Even the original design bitmap image can be included in EMB format. Only native EMB files provide 100% perfect scaling and transformation.

## Emblem

Embroidered design with a finished edge, applied to a garment after stitching, commonly an insignia of identification. Also known as a ‘crest’ or ‘patch’.

## Emblem work

Many Schiffli machines are used for creating emblems or logos. This work, however, uses only a small subset of the available functions of the Schiffli machine. Typically, for example, emblem work does not contain the bored holes or long Satin stitches which occur in lace designs. Emblem work is also stitched on Multihead machines.

## Embroidery

Decorative stitching on fabric. Generally involves non-lettering designs, but can also include lettering and/or monograms. Evidence of embroidery exists during the reign on Egyptian pharaohs, in the writings of Homer and from the Crusaders of the 12th century. Has evolved from hand-work to manual sewing machines and from hand-looms and Schiffli machines with hundreds of needles to high-speed, computerized multihead machines.

## EmbroideryConnect device

Wilcom-supplied device to enable connection of USB-enabled embroidery machines to an EmbroideryConnect machine network via a WiFi router.

## Embroidery disk

Embroidery disks are specially formatted floppy disks used to transfer designs from computer to embroidery machine. You can format embroidery disks and save designs to them from within EmbroideryStudio. The format you use will depend on the selected embroidery machine. You can also open designs from embroidery disk directly into EmbroideryStudio.

## Embroidery objects

In embroidery design, you build designs from basic shapes or ‘embroidery objects’. They are called ‘objects’ because they are discrete entities which can be selected and manipulated independently of each other. They are like ordinary vector objects in that they have certain characteristics or ‘properties’ such as color, size, position, and so on. They also have properties unique to embroidery such as stitch type and density. See also Vector objects.

## Embroidery thread

See Thread.

## Emery roller

The Schiffli roller on which threads are twisted and tensioned.

## Empty function

An ‘empty stitch’, or non-data stitch, is an industry term for any stitch with a zero movement (0, 0). However, EmbroideryStudio distinguishes between intentional empty stitches related to the machine functioning, and unintentional empty stitches, which can occur in small or pointed parts of shapes. An empty function is an empty stitch that the system processes as a machine function. It is not removed by the small stitch filter and is preserved when stitches are regenerated or the design is resized. See also Empty stitch.

## Empty jump

You create empty jumps (0,0) manually in EmbroideryStudio by digitizing with Penetrations Out. This prevents the needle from penetrating the fabric, forcing the machine to move across the design in a series of jumps. Also, use empty stitches or empty jumps when required by the selected machine format. See also Empty stitch.

## End Jump function

End Jump functions instruct the machine to use needle penetrations. When encoded in an output file, it normally converts to a Needle In function. See also Begin Jump function.

## Empty stitch

Empty stitch is a tight (zero length) lockstitch, used together with, or as an alternative to, tie-in and tie-off stitches, particularly in objects filled with light density stitching where standard tie-ins and tie-offs may be visible. Also, use empty stitches or empty jumps when required by the selected machine format. See also Empty jump and Empty function.

## EMX

Wilcom cross stitch file format.

## End X/Y

The coordinates of the last stitch.

## Enlargement drawing

The technical drawing, usually six times larger than the original design, indicating the stitches to be digitized. When you digitize with a tablet, you use an enlargement drawing to trace the shapes and outlines of the design in the same way you use backdrops on-screen. Before you start, you need to prepare the enlargement drawing. See also Digitizing tablet.

## Enlarger

The draftsman or designer who draws the technical drawing for the puncher to follow.

## Entry point

The entry point is the point where the thread enters the embroidery object. This should coincide with the exit point of the preceding object.

## Envelope

## EPS (Encapsulated PostScript)

A standard file format for importing and exporting PostScript language files among applications in a variety of environments. An ESP file is a PostScript file which describes a single page, usually an illustration. In general, the purpose of the EPS file is to be included (encapsulated) in another PostScript file and can contain any combination of text, graphics and images. EPS files normally include a small, low-resolution TIFF, or vector-based MS Windows® metafile image preview, as it will appear on a printed page.

## ESD

Native DOS format of Wilcom DOS ES – contains stitch data, like stitch types and densities, which permits better processing. ESD in later versions contains lettering objects with outlines.

## ESL

ESL is a file used to produce any Wilcom Schiffli Tnn file from EmbroideryStudio. It is read but not written by the Schiffli Converter to produce RCC Tnn files.

## ESS

ESS is the primary machine file format for Wilcom-developed Schiffli servo control systems. When the ESS file is read directly by a Wilcom Electronic Servo System (WESS), high data resolution and stitch accuracy are possible.

## Exit

To leave a current window or application.

## Exit point

The exit point is the point where thread leaves the embroidery object. This should coincide with the entry point of the next object.

## EXP

Stitch or ‘expanded’ file format native to Melco machines.

## Expanded file format

See Machine file.

## Expanded tape

An expanded tape which has every stitch of the design punched.

## Extension

See File extension.

## Fabrics

Fabrics have many properties, the main one being elasticity or ‘fabric stretch’. Surface texture, if present, is another property that requires different underlay types. When you choose a fabric for use with a particular design, the system pre-loads settings optimized for that fabric. These can be overridden on an object-by-object basis. See also Fabric settings.

## Fabric settings

predefined fabric settings include settings for all full-coverage stitch types. For each stitch type, spacing is preset. Additionally, the quality effects of pull compensation and underlay are also preset for each stitch type. Push, warping, and shearing are reduced by suitable underlay for the stitch type and fabric. Decorative effects such as Motif Fill are not affected when fabric settings are changed.

## Fabric stretch

Embroidery stitches pull the fabric inwards where the needle penetrates. This can cause the fabric to pucker, and gaps to appear in the embroidery. Use automatic pull compensation to counter this effect by ‘overstitching’ outlines of filled shapes.

## Facing

See Topping.

## Factory settings

These are the initial system settings as installed. They are a standard known setting that you can return to. Some customers want to create custom settings tailored to the exact fabric they are using most frequently. The ‘My Fabric’ settings are those retained in the design and can be saved to the template file.

## Fadenleiter

Fadenleiter is a mechanism on some Schiffli machines for controlling the feed and tension of yarns.

## Fadenleiter functions

Fadenleiter +/- functions instruct the machine to increase or decrease Fadenleiter stroke one increment. This means increasing or decreasing thread feed because the section is getting wider/narrower.

## FDR

An embroidery disk format native to Barudan machines.

## Festoon

Festoon is a mechanism on some Schiffli machines for reinforcing edges on scallops, etc, for a strong cutting edge. It is also the name of a stitch type.

## Festoon functions

Festoon In/Out functions instruct the machine to engage or disengage the festoon device.

## File

A named collection of specifically related information stored on a disk. Designs that have been saved are stored as files.

## File extension

The dot and three letters at the end of a filename such as ‘.BMP’. The extension identifies the file as a certain type, readable by certain applications.

## Filename

The name of a file, including the extension, e.g. Cat.BMP.

## Fill stitch

Series of running stitches commonly used to cover large areas. Different fill patterns can be created by altering the angle, length and repeat sequence of the stitches. Also known as Geflect stitch.

## Finishing

Processes done after embroidery is completed. Includes trimming loose threads, cutting or tearing away excess backing, removing facing or topping, cleaning any stains, pressing or steaming to remove wrinkles or hoop marks and packaging for sale or shipment.

## FIXPAT

The FIXPAT (Fix Pattern) utility is a conventional Schiffli visual-editing program which displays the tape file in the Jacquard card format with holes. The program is good for safety-checking designs and can be useful as a fast editor for known problem patterns as well as direct function editing.

## Flagging

Up and down motion of fabric under action of the needle, so named because of its resemblance to a waving flag. Often caused by improper framing of goods. Flagging may result in poor registration, unsatisfactory stitch formation and birdnesting.

## Float

Longer-than-normal Satin stitches that lay on top of a design, or the stitches made when the needle is disconnecting from the design, later removed.

## Floppy disk

A flexible disk permanently sealed in a square plastic jacket – e.g. HD/DD 3.5" floppy disk. Used for information storage ‘off-line’ for security and/or infrequently used data. Also used for transferring punched embroidery design (machine file) data from computer to embroidery machine.

## Florentine effect

## FMC

An embroidery disk format native to Barudan machines.

## Folder

A collection of files and subfolders that are stored together on a disk. Part of structure for organizing files on a disk.

## Font

A set of characters, including letters, numbers and other typographic symbols, of the same design and style. Sometimes called ‘alphabet’, even if it includes non-letter characters. See also Lettering.

## Following

The directions drawn on the enlargement by the designer as a guide for the puncher's advancement and sequence in punching.

## Fox test

Method of testing thread tension and soundness of timing. Sew the word FOX in one-inch Satin stitch block letters with each needle bar, then examine the reverse side for skipped stitches and correctly balanced ratio of top thread to bobbin thread. The correct balance is generally considered to be a one-third ratio of bobbin thread to two-thirds top thread. These letters are used because they require the movement of the pantograph in all directions, increasing the likelihood that the beginnings of timing irregularities will be discovered.

## Fractional spacing

Fractional spacing is used to place stitches more evenly in curved shapes, producing better quality embroidery with fewer stitches. Fractional spacing is particularly useful for columns of Satin stitches with sharp turns.

## Frame

Holding device to secure fabric under an embroidery head for stitching. May employ a number of means to maintain stability during the embroidery process, including clamps, vacuum devices, magnets, or springs. See also Hoop.

## Frame-out position

When you stitch out appliqué objects, you can set a frame-out position. This shifts the hoop out from under the needle, making it easier to place and trim the appliqué shapes. The frame out settings determine the distance and direction of the hoop movement.

## Free Line baseline

Free Line is the only type of baseline which does not have a fixed or pre-determined length. When you choose Free Line, the baseline will extend as long as you keep adding letters. You only need to mark its start point. See also Baseline.

## French inch

The French inch is a measurement used for spacing needles on the Schiffli machines (c. 27mm). See also Needle spacing.

## Fringe

Threads that are cut and hang loosely from the edge of a design.

## Function

See Machine Function.

## Geflect stitch

Geflect refers to light or heavy stitching used to fill in an area of a design with run stitches. It is also known as Ceeding or Tatami. See also Fill stitch.

## Generic Shiffli machine format

Because there are many types of Schiffli machine, individual settings can be quite different even though the capabilities are the same. To deal with this, Schiffli uses the concept of the ‘Generic Schiffli Machine’. The Schiffli generic machine format supports functions required for a wide range of machine types.

## Glitz

## Hard disk

A device for mass information storage. Usually the disk is fixed inside the system unit, and a second hard disk can be added. When you store information on the hard disk it will remain there until you delete it. As it has a finite capacity, file management is required.

## Hardware

Computer componentry, including monitor, keyboard, digitizing tablet, printer, scanner, sewing machine, etc.

## Heat transfer printing

A process which is sometimes used in the production of a printed design for commercial use employs heat transfer paper to which graphics are printed. This is then heat-fixed to a garment using an iron or heat-press. The process falls into the same category as printing. Printers that support heat transfer media in most cases provide an automatic mirror function in the printer driver as the image must be printed in reverse in order to be heat-transferred to a garment. See also Direct-to-garment printing.

## Image editing program

See Graphics application.

## Image preparation

Cleaning up scanned images as input to embroidery digitizing. This may involve any one or a combination of the following techniques: reducing the number of colors, adding or emphasizing outlines, removing noise, dithering or anti-aliasing, eliminating unnecessary detail, cropping sections or eliminating backgrounds.

## Imported outlines

Designs read from non-EMB outline – CND or PCH – where stitches have been generated in EmbroideryStudio (or equivalent) from original outlines and stitching data.

## Imported stitches

Designs read from stitch or ‘expanded’ files, with or without outline recognition, but stitches have not been regenerated through stitch processing. Note that if you change a stitch design – e.g. add a lettering object – the status changes to ‘Processed Stitches’ even though the imported stitches may not have been regenerated.

## INC

Individual Needle Control (INC) was a mechanism originally developed for Saurer Pentamat machines whereby each needle/borer position across the whole machine could be activated or de-activated individually, either under program or manual control.

## INP

Wilcom condensed file format.

## Input method

See Digitizing tool.

## Jacquard card

Historically Schiffli designs were stored on Jacquard cards of which there are two types – Plauen and Saurer. Named after Joseph M Jacquard, inventor of the Jacquard loom, Jacquard cards contain a stitch-by-stitch interpretation of the design together with machine functions, exactly as the embroidery machine will read it, encoded as a series of holes. Later applied to 68 mm tape used to program automated embroidery machines. See also Tape code.

## Jagged edge

Technique for creating rough edges, to create shading effects, or to imitate fur or other fluffy textures in your design.

## JPG

JPEG file interchange bitmap image format.

## Jump

A frame or hoop movement without a needle penetration, commonly used to get from one point in a design to another. In Schiffli terms a Jump stitch means a frame movement in Needle Out mode.

## Jump function

Jump(M) functions cause frame movements without needle penetrations and are used to move smoothly from one part of a design to another.

## Justification

The position of lettering on the embroidery baseline.

## Lacework

Lacework involves the use of threads to produce overall embroidery of full-length fabrics. Most often used to embellish women's apparel and home fashions. Such work typically uses boring. It is the most widely used application for Schiffli machines.

## Line art

A drawing with only two colors – usually black and white.

## List box

A single-line dialog that opens to display a list of choices.

## Lockstitch

Commonly referred to as a lock-down or tack-down stitch, a lockstitch is formed by three or four consecutive stitches of at least a 10-point movement. It should be used at the end of all columns, fills and at the end of any element in your design where jump stitches will follow, such as color changes or the end of a design. May be stitched in a triangle, star or in a straight line. Lock stitch is also the name of the type of stitch formed by the hook and needle of home sewing machines, as well as computerized embroidery machines.

## Lockstitch machines

Both Schiffli and Multihead machines are lockstitch machines, forming stitches in the same way as a home sewing machine. Lockstitch operations involve two threads – top and bottom. The top thread is driven by a needle, the bottom by a shuttle. The bottom thread ‘locks’ the top thread in place, hence the name ‘lockstitch’. See also Multihead lockstitch machine.

## Logical machine functions

Schiffli makes a distinction between ‘logical’ and ‘physical’ machine functions. The logical machine function is what you, the digitizer, want to perform – for example, start or stop boring. Logical functions are saved as ‘object properties’ in the native Wilcom EMB design file.

## Logo

Name, symbol or trademark of a company or organization. Short for logotype.

## Looms

See Schiffli.

## Loom run

The stitching of one complete pattern in one row on a Schiffli machine.

## Looping

Loops on the surface of embroidery generally caused by poor top tension or tension problems. Typically occurs when polyester top thread has been improperly tensioned.

## Machine file

Machine or ‘stitch’ files are low-level formats for direct use by embroidery machines. They contain only stitch coordinates and machine functions. Machine files are generally not suited to scaling because stitches are not regenerated during rescaling. See also Design file.

## Machine format

Different embroidery machines understand different languages. They have their own control commands for the various machine functions. Before you can stitch a design, it must be in a format which can be understood by the target machine. Common formats include Barudan, Brother, Fortran, Happy, Marco, Meistergram, Melco, Pfaff, Stellar, Tajima, Toyota, Ultramatic and ZSK.

## Machine function

Machine functions are commands for a specific embroidery machine. These include color changes, thread trims, jumps, machine stops, needles in/out, and boring begin/end. Schiffli makes a distinction between ‘logical’ and ‘physical’ machine functions. See also Logical machine functions and Physical machine functions.

## Machine unit

The ‘machine unit’ is the smallest frame movement which the embroidery machine can perform. In Schiffli machines there are three types – Plauen (1/6 mm or 0.1667mm), Saurer (0.1mm), and hi-resolution WESS.

## Machine setup

Before you can send designs for stitching, you must configure the machine in EmbroideryStudio. You can add machines, change settings for machines already set up, or delete machines that are no longer required.

## Magic wand

Technique for creating embroidery designs by automatically digitizing color blocks in electronic images.

## Manual object

When you open a stitch format file without outline recognition, it becomes a single ‘manual’ object. This object consists of individual needle penetration points and has only general and connector properties. When you transform (scale, rotate, mirror) a manual object, the original stitch density does not change.

## Max/Min stitch length

The minimum and maximum stitch lengths allowable in a design determine the outside limits as measured between needle penetration points. They are governed by the minimum and maximum frame movements that the machine can make.

## Maximize button

For windows, the small box in the center of the group of three at the right of the title bar. Click the Maximize button to enlarge a window to its maximum size.

## Memory

The place in the computer’s system unit that stores information while you are working with it. If you exit without saving information in memory, it will be lost.

## Menu bar

The menu bar contains dropdown menus of commands. Some of the same commands are available on the toolbar.

## Menu chart

The menu chart provided with the software lets you select commands directly from the digitizing tablet using the puck. You need to ‘register’ it before use.

## Minimize button

For windows, the small box to the left of the group of three at the right of the title bar. Click the Minimize button to reduce a window to its minimum size.

## Minimum stitch length

The minimum movement of the hoop. It is measured between needle penetration points. See also Max/Min stitch.

## Mirror

Duplication of an object in the Y and/or X axis. The location and orientation of the mirrored stitches are determined by location and angle of the axis of reflection relative to the position of the original stitches.

## Mirror-merge

Mirror-Merge Array can create multiple copies of designs, such as badges, spaced in rows and columns for faster stitchouts. Mirror-Merge Reflect can duplicate and mirror designs simultaneously. You can use it to quickly create borders or merge duplicates into a symmetrical object such as a heart. Mirror-Merge Wreath can duplicate objects around a center point. The Kaleidoscope tool works like Wreath but mirrors objects as well.

## Mitre corner

A type of Smart Corner. Mitre Corners create a sharp line at the intersection of the two columns. They are designed primarily for corners between 75° and 90°. See also Smart Corners.

## Modal dialog

A dialog which, while open, prevents the user from selecting any control or object outside it. Changes made to settings inside the dialog are not effective until it is closed.

## Modem

Unit to telegraphically send computer information from one computer to another.

## Monitor

In computer terms, a device that accepts video signals from a computer and displays information. Monitors generally employ cathode-ray tubes or flat-panel displays to project images. In practice, the terms monitor and display are used interchangably. In digitizing terms, the monitor is where digitizing or stitching progress can be followed, stitch-by-stitch.

## Monogram

Embroidered design composed of one or more letters, usually the initials of a name. Can also consist of borders or designs to mark ownership of items such as clothing, caps, handkerchiefs, etc.

## Moss stitch

## Motif run

Motifs which are linked together along a digitized line. You can create decorative outlines using any motif from the list.

## Motif set

Motifs are stored in ‘motif sets’ similar to fonts. There are two predefined motif sets. One contains single motifs for fills which use the same pattern in both forward and backward rows. The other set is intended for use with two-part motifs which use complementary patterns for forward and backward rows. You can also define your own ‘motif sets’ to organize and classify motifs of your own creation.

## Mouse

A device, equipped with control buttons and designed to roll about on the table next to the keyboard. As the mouse moves, its circuits relay signals that move a pointer on the screen.

## MST

MST is a Laesser file type. It includes same stitch data as Laesser DAT. (Not supported in Schiffli ES e4.)

## Multicolored designs

Multicolored designs contain more than one color. Most Schiffli machines do not support automatic color change. That is, there is no mechanism to activate individual or groups of needles. Thus multicolored designs are expensive to produce because operators need to manually trim the threads and re-thread the needles.

## Multihead lockstitch machine

Multihead lockstitch machines have a horizontal frame. The needles are vertical, and are grouped in heads. They are mainly used for stitching individual items – e.g. badges, garments, which are stretched in separate hoops attached to the frame under each head. A multihead machine can have up to 24 heads, and each head can have up to 20 or more needles. Thread change and trims can be done automatically. See also Lockstitch machine.

## Multi-appliqué

A type of appliqué object composed of more than one piece of fabric and bordered by various types of embroidery objects.

## Native designs

Native designs refer to designs created in EmbroideryStudio software (or equivalent).

## Native file format

A design saved in the original format of the application you are working with is said to be the ‘native’ file format. It can also refer to the machine file format required by a specific embroidery machine. When saved to another format, it is known as a non-native format.

## Needle

Small, slender piece of steel with a hole for thread and a point for piercing fabric. A machine needle differs from a handwork needle – the machine needle’s eye is found at its pointed end. Machine embroidery needles may come with a) sharp points for piercing heavy, tightly woven fabric, b) ball points which glide between fibers of knit, or c) a variety of specialty points, such as wedge points, which are used for leather.

## Needle addressing

Some machines support ‘needle addressing’. Needle numbers correspond to slots in the color palette. Each color in the design corresponds to a needle number. Older multi-needle machines simply move to the next needle whenever a color-change function is encountered. In either case, the machine must have the correct thread colors loaded for each needle to stitch out correctly.

## Needle in/needle out functions

The Needle In and Needle Out functions instruct the machine whether or not to use needle penetrations. You can enter these functions automatically using the Penetrations tool.

## Needle points

You can view needle points in a design to check density or, for instance, to select stitches for editing.

## Needle spacing

Needle spacing is the distance between adjacent needles of a Schiffli embroidery machine. Typical values are 27.07 mm and 27.04mm. The software lets you set up and adjust this value to suit the type of machine which will stitch the design.

## Nesting

Nesting lets you create or insert an object at an exact point of the stitching sequence. You can ‘nest’ an object in the middle of another object’s stitching sequence to prevent long connectors being generated.

## Network

To link embroidery machines via a central computer and disk-drive system, usually via a modem or network card. A group of machines linked via a central computer.

## Network folder location

The logical location of a folder on a network. Contains the PC name together with the folder name – e.g. \\\\My PC\\EmbroideryMachine1.

## Noise filtering

Noise filtering means restoring the solid color blocks of original artwork in scanned images. This is achieved by merging different shades into one solid color. Noise filtering is important for automatic digitizing because it makes it easier for the software to identify solid color blocks which become embroidery objects in the resulting design. It also cleans up blurred or mottled areas of color.

## NORMAL template

The NORMAL template is the default template supplied with the software. It contains current property settings as well as a selection of preset styles. These styles include variations on the current property settings. For example, &lt;PRESET_SATIN_1&gt; and &lt;PRESET_SATIN_2&gt; contains different stitch spacing settings for Satin stitches. You can view and modify the settings for these styles at any time. See also Templates.

## Objects

In computer science, ‘objects’ are regarded as any discrete item that can be selected and manipulated, such as an onscreen graphic. In object-oriented programming, objects include data and the procedures necessary to operate on that data. See also Embroidery objects.

## Object outline

See Design file.

## Object properties

All embroidery objects in EmbroideryStudio contain defining settings or ‘values’. The values stored with an object become its ‘properties’. All objects have certain properties in common such as size and position. There are other, more specific properties of objects which depend on the object type. The most important property of all embroidery objects is stitch type.

## Object recognition

See Outline recognition.

## Object type

An object has a type, shape, thread type and color, stitching settings and a position in the stitching order. The object type may or may not determine the intended final appearance of the stitching.

## Offset Object

Software function used to create new outlines from the outlines of selected objects.

## Ornament

## Options

Options provide software with extra functionality that can be purchased by registered owners of the product.

## Outline file

See Design file.

## Outline recognition

When you convert a machine file to outline format, EmbroideryStudio reads the data stitch-by-stitch according to the needle penetration points. The software then ‘recognizes’ stitch types, spacing and length values, stitch effects, and can determine object outlines.

## Outline stitch

Stitch such as Run or Satin used to outline an embroidery object.

## Overall embroidery

Overall embroidery is embroidery which covers the entire fabric. This includes lacework where the backing fabric is actually removed after manufacture. Overall embroidery is typical of Schiffli manufacture, less common with Multihead.

## Overshoot

Overshooting is a technique used by Schiffli punchers to reduce distortion of fabric by pulling more thread from the cone and reducing the pulling force of the thread.

## Overview window

Use the Overview window to view a thumbnail of the design. The window is updated whenever you make a change, and can be used to zoom in or pan across the design workspace.

## Paint package

Software application that creates or allows you to edit image files. You can create lines and filled areas as well as edit the image pixel-by-pixel using paintbrushes, erasers and spraypaint tools. Examples of image editing programs are Adobe Photoshop, Jasc PaintShop Pro and Corel PHOTO-PAINT®. See also Graphics application.

## Pan

Use Pan to view parts of a design which are not currently visible in the design workspace.

## Paper tape

Traditional recording media used in the embroidery industry is the paper tape. The tape coding process produces the final design in stitch format – a stitch-by-stitch interpretation of the design – exactly as the embroidery machine will read it. Now largely replaced by floppy disk, tapes are still used by older machines. More specifically, stitch data paper tapes are eight-channel paper tapes which, in effect, are hard copies of 8 bit binary code.

## Parallel port

A connection on a computer, usually LPT1, where you plug in the cable for a parallel printer and/or a dongle. Parallel ports are used to connect some embroidery machines. They are named LPT1, LPT2, etc. When you set up a parallel machine connection, select the parallel port and the required protocol, and complete the machine setup procedure.

## Partial appliqué

## Print preview

Use to preview design and design information before printing a Production Worksheet. The design is displayed as it will be printed.

## Process

The Process feature lets you adjust the density of one or more stitch types across the whole or selected parts of a design. Change stitch density in order to stitch on a different fabric or with a different thread. Alternatively, you may want to make production cheaper by reducing the overall stitch count. Processing a machine file is similar to converting it to a design file when opening except that you can process only selected objects or stitches.

## Processed stitches

Designs read from stitch or ‘expanded’ files where stitches have been regenerated by processing.

## Production worksheet

The production worksheet is the link between the designer and the embroidery machine operator. It contains a design preview as well as essential production information, including the design size, the color sequence and any special instructions.

## Program

A computer program or ‘application’ is generally used for a particular kind of work, such as word processing or database management.

## Program split

A decorative fill stitch which can be applied to various object types where needle penetrations form a tiled pattern. Different preset patterns are available for use.

## Puck

See Digitizing puck.

## Puckering

Result of the fabric being gathered by the stitches. Many possible causes include incorrect density, loose hooping, lack of backing, incorrect tension or dull needle.

## Pull compensation

Digitizing technique that takes into account the distortion of a design that will occur because of the interaction of thread with fabric. ‘Push and pull’ will cause a circle digitized perfectly round to sew with the sides pushed out, resulting in an egg shape. Generally, it is necessary to extend horizontal elements and reduce vertical elements. See also Automatic pull compensation.

## Punching

Conversion of artwork into a series of commands to be read by an embroidery machine’s computer or controller. The term refers to an earlier method of machine embroidery whereby designs are ‘punched’ to paper tape. A part of the machine, called an automat, reads the paper tape or Jacquards punched with holes representing stitches, pantograph movements and other commands. While still capable of producing paper tape, many digitizing systems now store this information on disk formats. See also Digitizing.

## Push-pull

When any stitch is sewn into fabric, the tension in the thread between needle penetrations can build up and result in a ‘push-pull’ effect. This can cause distortions in your sewn designs, poor stitch registration and even the bunching of the fabric. The degree of distortion can be affected by the following factors: stitch density, fabric type, underlay, backing type, thread type and garment orientation. See also Stitch-Pull.

## Quilting

In general, the process of making a quilt. Specifically, the stitching of patterns into the quilt layers to add strength and decoration to a quilt. Stitching includes top, batting, and backing, to form decorative patterns on the quilt surface and hold the layers together.

## RAM

Random Access Memory, computer chip maintaining memory.

## Random factor

You can eliminate unwanted patterns and distribute stitches evenly within a shape using a random factor. Apply random factors to Tatami Partition lines or Program Splits. You can use this effect to imitate different textures such as fur, grass, leaves, etc.

## Raster image

See Bitmap image.

## Read

To open a design which has been written on a design card or to an embroidery machine.

## Reader/writer

A device that allows you to download/upload designs to and from a design card. Cards can be purchased from your dealer or from designers on the net. Cards can have designs on them or are blank for you to read/write from/to. The cards are inserted into the embroidery module attached to a sewing machine. The R/W will allow you to have the PC and sewing machine quite separate from one another.

## Recognition

See Outline recognition.

## Redraw

The screen display is refreshed. This is useful when parts of the display have become obscured in the course of editing. See also Slow Redraw.

## Reduce colors

See Image preparation.

## Reference point

A point that can be aligned with the grid. For example, you can set the grid reference point to the design center. This is easier and faster than moving the whole design.

## Refresh

See Redraw.

## Registration

Correct registration is achieved when all stitches and design elements line up correctly.

## Relative Pointer Setting

This setting shows the pointer position as an absolute value from the first needle point of the design. Useful for checking that the design fits a given area.

## Relative

The distance the pointer is from a previously marked point, or from the previous stitch point.

## Repeat

Layout used for making emblems or designs on a fabric span that are repeated at regular intervals. The design repeat is defined by the distance between needles – the point at which the design repeats itself.

## Repeat color change (RCC)

A Repeat Color Change (RCC) is a mechanism on some Schiffli machines to change the pattern of active needles in order to modify the repeat pattern and/or thread color.

## Repeat sequence

If you select fewer colors than the design requires, the selected colors are repeated. For example, if your design requires four colors and you’ve only selected two in the Building Stop Sequence list, colors 3 and 4 will be the same as original colors 1 and 2.

## Resequence

You can change the position of a selected object by cutting it, then pasting it somewhere else in the stitching sequence, or by using the Resequence command. You can also resequence objects by color or using the Color-Object List.

## Resizing

See Scaling.

## Resolution

Resolution determines the number of dots per inch (dpi) used to create an image. The higher the value, the clearer the image, but the more storage space required. A resolution of 75 dpi generally produces good results.

## RGB

RGB stands for red, green, and blue. It is the system used by computer monitors to create color.

## Rhinestones

See Bling.

## Rhinestone template

This is the design layout on which rhinestones are initially placed for creation of a ‘rhinestone transfer’. This is what is created from the cutters or engravers.

## Rhinestone transfer

This is the rhinestone design ready for heat transfer to the final product – e.g. a T-shirt.

## RPM functions

RPM +/- functions instruct the machine to increase or decrease machine speed in increments from current or normal.

## Right-click

To press and release the right mouse button. See also Click.

## Rollover

The point at which the fabric is shifted – loosened and reset – vertically to continue stitching. Common on long fabric Schiffli machines.

## Rotation handles

When you select an object, selection handles display at its extremities. If you click the object again, rotation and skew handles appear around the object. Rotation handles appear at the corners of the object and an anchor point displays at the object’s center. Skew handles are diamond-shaped and appear at the center-top and bottom of the object. See also Selection handles.

## Run stitch

Run stitch, also known as ‘Walk stitch’, places a single row of stitches along a digitized line. The needle penetrations are placed in consecutive order. Run is generally used for stitching outlines and connector stitches. Run stitch length can be set to automatically vary in order to follow tight curves.

## SAS

SAS is a Saurer SLC, Saurer SLC RCC, Saurer SLC Standard or Saurer Pentamat file format.

## Sash

A fabric strip that separates blocks in a setting, framing them and making the quilt larger.

## Satin stitch

Type of fill stitch. Formed by closely arranged zigzag stitches, it can be stitched at any angle and with varying lengths. The thread is laid across a shape with a zigzag sewing action where two stitches form a column. Hence it is only suitable for small or narrow shapes. As the stitches are almost parallel, Satin provides good coverage. It is often used for lettering, outlining, and details. Because there are generally no needle penetrations breaking up the fill, Satin stitch creates a glossy effect.

## Saurer

Saurer is a Schiffli machine brand and type as well as a Jacquard card encoding format. The format has three variants with support added for more modern RCC and Pentamat machines. Sometimes it is referred to as the ‘left hand machine’ because the threading requires the hook to be held in the left hand.

## Saurer SHC

SHC is a high level code format which is designed to be machine independent in order to control both Saurer and Plauen type mechanisms. The format supports thread trimming.

## Saurer SLC

SLC is a Saurer low level code format for Schiffli designs.

## Save

To store (design) information in a file. Each time you save a design, you replace the previous version using the filename. You should save your design frequently.

## Scalability

Ability to enlarge or reduce a design. In expanded format, most scaling is limited to 10 to 20%, because the stitch count remains constant despite final design size. In condensed formats, on the other hand, scale changes may be more dramatic, because stitch count and density may be varied.

## Scale factor

This option allows you to automatically scale CND designs as you load them. For example, to scale the imported design to 120% of the original, you would enter a scale factor of 1.2.

## Scaling

Ability to enlarge or reduce a design in size. In stitch or ‘expanded’ format, most scaling is limited to ±5% because the stitch count remains constant despite final design size. In design or ‘outline’ formats, scale changes may be more dramatic because stitch count and density are recalculated.

## Scanner

A device that converts physical images into digital form so that they can be stored and manipulated by computer. Scanning allows you to take scanned images as a basis for embroidery design.

## Scanning resolution

Most scanners require you to enter scanning resolution information. Resolution determines the number of dots per inch (dpi) used to create a drawing. The higher the value, the clearer the image but larger the file. For digitizing purposes, use a maximum resolution of 300 dpi (dots per inch). A resolution of 72 dpi (screen resolution) will usually be sufficient. Generally speaking, the smaller the source image and/or more detail it contains, the higher the resolution needs to be.

## Schiffli card

Plauen or Saurer type Jacquard card.

## Schiffli card image

Jacquard card electronic encoding produces a ‘tape file’ which is essentially an electronic ‘image’ of the card. Schiffli outputs two tape file formats – T10 (for Plauen) and T15 (for Saurer). See also Tape code.

## Schiffli disk

Schiffli disks include Saurer SLC/SHC, Heinzle, Hiraoka, and Laesser.

## Schiffli machine

Commercial embroidery machine that utilizes the combination of needle and shuttle to form a stitch. Massive in size. Some schiffli machines – also known as looms – weigh 10 tons and have up to 1024 needles. Most Schiffli machines do not have automatic thread trim or automatic color change. Excellent for emblem production, the creation of lace, embroidery production on oversized items and production orders of very large quantities.

## Screen calibration

You need to calibrate your monitor so that designs at 1:1 scale appear at real size. Do this when you first install EmbroideryStudio, whenever you change your monitor, or adjust your monitor’s horizontal or vertical controls.

## Screen printing

Screen printing is a more complex process than direct-to-garment, requiring the creation of a screen for each of the spot colors (Pantone) that make up the design. There may be multiple screens for each spot color, depending on how the design is layered. See also Direct-to-garment printing.

## Screen resolution

See Pixels.

## Scroll bar

The bar at the bottom and right edge of a window whose contents are not entirely visible. Each scroll bar contains a small box, called a scroll box, and two scroll arrows to allow different types of scrolling.

## Security code

Options in EmbroideryStudio are controlled by a security device installed on the computer. Security access codes entered into the software are sent to this security device. Each security device has a unique serial number and identity code.

## Security device

See Dongle.

## Segments

Filled embroidery objects are generally built as several discrete ‘segments’. Travel runs are typically used to connect them. All segments, however, form part of the same object. Where they meet, the push-pull effect on the fabric during stitchout may cause gaps to appear.

## Select

To highlight an object or group of objects for the purpose of editing. Only selected items can be edited.

## Selection handles

Eight small squares that appear symmetrically at the corners and edges of a selected object. Use them to position and resize objects. See also Rotation handles.

## Selection marquee

The dotted rectangle that appears when you select a range of items. See also Bounding box.

## Sequence

See Stitching Sequence.

## Sequins

Sequins are small plastic disks with a hole usually in the center. They are stored on reels joined one-to-another by a weak link. They are stitched onto fabric by mechanical placement in the path of the sewing needle.

## Sequin attachment

Sequin attachments are computerized or manual machine devices which apply sequins by stitching, glue or heat.

## Sequin mode

Sequin mode enables quick digitizing of Drop Sequin functions. See also Drop Sequin functions.

## Serial port

A connection point on a computer where you plug a serial communications device such as a modem. PC serial COM ports are male connectors, and can be either 9-pin or 25-pin. They are named COM1, COM2, COM3, etc. The number of available ports limits the number of devices you can connect. If additional ports are required, you can add them. Multi-port serial cards can also be used.

## Serial port setup

Here you can adjust Baud, Data Bits, Stop Bits, Parity values. These settings must be identical to those of the embroidery machine. The type of handshaking must match the type of cable you are using.

## Serif

In typography, serifs are semi-structural elements on the ends of strokes that make up letters and symbols. A typeface that has serifs is called a serif typeface. A typeface without serifs is called sans-serif.

## Sharpen edges

Tool used to prepare outlined images for automatic digitizing. Sharpen Edges automatically sharpens outlines and reduces noise. Areas enclosed by a black outline are reduced to a single color. Outline sharpening makes it easier for the software to recognize distinct areas in the artwork. These areas then become the embroidery objects of the finished design. Use it particularly if the outlines are blurry, fuzzy or indistinct.

## Short stitch

Digitizing technique that places shorter stitches in curves and corners to avoid an unnecessarily bulky build-up of stitches.

## Shortcut key

A key stroke or a series of keystrokes you can use to perform a task instead of using the mouse. For example, Ctrl+C actions the Copy command.

## Side movement

The distance the frame can move horizontally on a Schiffli machine, measured in quarters.

## Side stick

Adjustable bars with pins on each end of the Schiffli frame to hang or pin the ends of the goods being spanned.

## Sizing handles

See Selection handles.

## Skew handles

See Rotation handles.

## Slow Redraw

Use to redraw your design slowly. Slow Redraw lets you view the stitching and color sequence of a design in slow motion.

## Small stitches

Use the Small Stitch Filter to remove unwanted small stitches from a design automatically.

## Smart corners

Sharp points in a shape may cause a bunching of stitches and needle penetrations which can create a hard spot in the embroidery and may damage the fabric or needle. Smart Corners helps you control sharp corners in Column A and Column C objects. See also Mitre Corner and Cap Corner.

## Smart design

Toolset used to create embroidery designs by automatically digitizing electronic images. Smart Design automatically converts bitmap images to fully digitized embroidery with little or no intervention. See also Auto-Digitizing.

## Software

Programs, such as MS Windows® and EmbroideryStudio, which run your computer.

## Span

The prepared goods ready to load the Schiffli machine. It may contain many yards of goods.

## Span cloth

Fabric attached permanently to the roller of the Schiffli machine with pins onto which the fabrics are attached.

## Spangles

See Sequins.

## Spanning

The loading of the goods on the frame, placing it under tension preparatory for embroidery.

## Specialty fill

A fill stitch capability that produces a fill with a ‘relief’ or motif design within the fill-stitch area, e.g. Pattern Fill.

## Specialty threads

Threads designed for effects such as shine, glitter, iridescence or thickness. The threads often are made from synthetic materials including rayon, mercerized cotton, metallics and textured nylon.

## Spiral contour

Spiral Contour creates a single, continuous line of stitching that spirals around to fill the shape. Typically, it is used for rings and borders, but it is also suitable for other closed shapes. See also Contour stitch.

## Split alternate

Split Alternate is a variation of Tatami split. See also User Defined Split.

## Split object

You can split embroidery objects that were created with the Column A, Column B, and Column C tools, if Satin or Tatami, or Program Split is the selected stitch type.

## SPI

Stitches per inch – system for measuring density or the number of Satin stitches in an inch of embroidery.

## SPM

Stitches per minute – system for measuring the running speed of an embroidery machine.

## SR/SD

Melco Star format. ‘Star’ and ‘Superstar’ are types of Melco machine (quite old now).

## Stabilizer

See Backing.

## Standard backstitch

The rows are approximately parallel, with every backstitch row slightly shorter than the forward row. Because the rows are different lengths, there are fewer small stitches at the edge of the shape, reducing possible damage to the fabric. Standard backstitch is suitable for high density fills. See also Backstitch.

## Standard Contour

Standard Contour creates rows of stitches across the shape, perpendicular to the digitized stitch angle. The number of stitch lines is constant, so the stitching is denser where the shape is narrower, and more open where the shape is wider. See also Contour stitch.

## Start/End Boring Tension functions

See Boring Tension functions.

## Station

See Repeat Color Change (RCC).

## Status bar

Provides information about the whole design: number of stitches, position of the design (X, Y), number of colors (C), number of stops (S), etc.

## STC

Gunold stitch or ‘expanded’ file format.

## Stemstitch

A detail stitch that can be used to outline items or fill in areas. It is used for stems and vines with other decorative stitches, or as an outline for Satin or Motif fills.

## Step stitch

Series of parallel stitches commonly used to cover large areas. Different step patterns can be created by altering the angle, the length and repeat sequence of the stitches.

## Stippling

A method of creating a fill made of run stitches which meander around within a border. Often used in quilting.

## Stitch

A stitch is one needle penetration. May also refer to the thread spanning one needle penetration and the next.

## Stitch angle

The stitch angle is the angle the overall stitching follows within a shape. The shape may have a fixed stitch angle – e.g. 45° to the horizontal – or multiple stitch angles.

## Stitch bunching

Standard stitch spacing is calculated at the outside edge of a shape. With sharp curves, spacing which provides adequate coverage on the outside edge may cause bunching along the inside edge. This may cause thread breakage when stitching out.

## Stitch count

Stitch count refers to the number of stitches in a design. In EmbroideryStudio one stitch is considered one machine revolution. See also Design information.

## Stitch density

The number of stitches per given area (or stitch lines per distance in a fill).

## Stitch editing

Digitizing feature that allows one or more stitches in a pattern to be deleted or altered.

## Stitch file

See Machine file.

## Stitch length

The distance between two needle penetration points. For maximum stitch length, the length is measured according to the X and Y co-ordinates, whichever is greater. Run stitch length can be set to automatically vary in order to follow tight curves. See also Max/Min stitch length.

## Stitch List

The Stitch List displays stitch number, stitch coordinates, stitch length, stitch function, stitch color. When you select a stitch in the list, it is simultaneously selected in your design.

## Stitch processing

The calculation of stitch information by means of specialized software, allowing scaling of expanded format designs with density compensation.

## Stitch processor

A patented software feature developed by Wilcom International P/L. Stitch Processor is a function of the software which interprets ‘raw’ stitch data and converts it into objects that the software can recognize.

## Stitch-pull

See Push-Pull.

## Stitch type

Three basic stitch types are available with lockstitch machines – Run, Satin and Tatami (Weave). EmbroideryStudio provides many variants of these.

## Stitch shortening

When a shape takes a sharp turn, the spacing of stitches on the inside of the shape decreases rapidly. This results in bunching on the inside and gaps on the outside of the shape. The longer the stitch, the worse the problem. Automatic Stitch Shortening solves this problem by eliminating thread bunching. The embroidery has smooth, even stitch spacing throughout. It also reduces thread breakages during production.

## Stitch spacing

Spacing between two consecutive needle penetrations on the same side of a column. The smaller the value, the greater the stitch density. For more open stitching, use larger values.

## Stitching defects

Stitching defects may appear in the form of gaps between filled areas, fabric show-through and thread breaks. These are often caused by incorrect stitching settings – e.g. setting pull compensation too small for the fabric stretchiness.

## Stitch-to-machine

The software lets you send a design directly to the embroidery machine for stitching if it is connected to your computer.

## Stitching direction

Stitching direction can affect embroidery quality because of the Push-Pull effect. Only closed embroidery objects can be reversed.

## Stitching sequence

The embroidery objects in a design form a stitching sequence. Initially, objects are stitched in the order in which they were created or the design assembled. You can change the position of a selected object by cutting it, then pasting it somewhere else in the sequence, or by using the Resequence command. You can also resequence objects by color or with the Color-Object List.

## Stock designs

Embroidery designs readily available on disk or proprietary embroidery card. Digitized embroidery designs that are commercially available for general use by embroiderers.

## Stop code

Stop codes are interpreted as ‘explicit stops’. The machine stops stitching.

## Stop function

If you want the embroidery machine to stop for any special reason while stitching a design, you need to insert a Stop function in the stitching sequence. If there are Stops in a design, these can be read into EmbroideryStudio as either a Color-change function or a Stop function.

## Straight stitch machine

Machine, which features needles that move up and down in one spot. The pantograph pushes the design along. The majority of commercial embroidery machines use this type of needle movement.

## STX

Datastitch stitch or ‘expanded’ file format.

## Stuepfel

Stuepfel is a Schiffli machine attachment for cleaning out holes after boring.

## Stuepfel functions

Stuepfel In/Out functions instruct the machine when to switch to the Stuepfel device from the borer. Borer In engages both the borer and the Stuepfel.

## Styles

A style is a group of property settings stored under a unique name. You can save any combination of settings to a style. This makes it easy to apply these settings to selected embroidery and lettering objects. When you apply a style to an object, the style settings replace its current properties. Any properties not specified in the style, retain their current settings.

## Sublimation

Sublimation means a change from a solid to gaseous state and back to a solid without becoming liquid. Thus dye particles migrate from the paper as a gas, to bond with a polymer – fabric or other material – and become solid again. The transfer is effected using high heat (205°C) and pressure, thus guaranteeing that the image penetrates and becomes an integral part of the substrate.

## Sublimation printing

Sublimation is similar to DTG printing but the process uses solid inks which give a more even gradation of color rather than the liquid inks in DTG printing. With sublimation printing, inks are printed onto a release paper and then transferred onto a fabric or other surface.

## Supported machine type

A machine is ‘supported’ by the software either via a direct implementation in the software for a specific machine or via the MS Windows® operating system – e.g. a MS Windows® supported printer or MS Windows® supported cutter.

## Swiss embroidery

Satin stitch embroidery. Also recalls the origins of automated embroidery in Switzerland, where the Schiffli embroidery machine was developed in the 1800s by Isaak Groebli. Embroidery remains a government-supported industry in Switzerland today.

## System administrator

The System Administrator is responsible for the entire Enterprise Network and security. In smaller enterprises, the System Administrator is also usually responsible for database administrations.

## System requirements

What your computer’s hardware and software, operating together, can support. System requirements are printed on software packages, design disk cards and packs, CDs and other computer accessories. You need to know what your system can and cannot support, as sometimes a system is not capable of handling new software without adding memory or disk space.

## Tablet

See Digitizing tablet.

## Tackdown

Zigzag stitch, placed after placement and cutting lines, and used to fix appliqué patches to the background fabric before cover stitching is applied.

## Tape

See Paper tape.

## Tape code

More recently, the recording media used in the embroidery industry has been the paper tape. Jacquard card electronic encoding produces a ‘tape file’ which is essentially an electronic ‘image’ of the card. Schiffli outputs two tape file formats – T10 (for Plauen) and T15 (for Saurer). As the newer Schiffli machines can read floppy disks, there are various Schiffli machine floppy disk formats. You therefore need to convert the basic tape file to the required disk format.

## Tatami stitch

Series of run stitches, commonly used to cover large, irregular shapes. Stitches are laid in rows traversing back and forth across the shape. These can be parallel or slightly turning. Different fill patterns can be created by varying the stitch length, angle or sequence. Also known as Weave stitch.

## Tatami offset fractions

With Tatami fills you can specify how each row is offset in order to create patterns formed by needle penetrations. You do this by adjusting either offset fractions or partition lines. By adjusting offset fractions, you can create textured fills where the stitch penetrations are more clearly visible.

## Tatami partition lines

With Tatami fills you can specify how each row is offset in order to create patterns formed by needle penetrations. Partition lines, with up to eight offsets, can create more patterns.

## Tatami underlay

Tatami underlay is used to stabilize large, filled shapes. It resembles an extremely open Tatami fill stitch, where rows of stitches are placed across the object to create the underlay.

## Team Names

The Team Names feature lets you create designs with multiple names. For example, you can use the same logo with different names for sports teams or corporate uniforms without having to create multiple copies of the same design.

## Templates

Templates are special files used for storing styles and default property settings. The NORMAL template packaged with the software provides a selection of preset styles. You can modify these as required and save them back to the NORMAL template or to your own custom templates. Use these when digitizing frequently-used design types to save time re-adjusting the current property settings. For example, a custom template may include standard objects and sample lettering. It may simply have preferred stitch settings, lettering font and size, and colors set as current settings. Or it may have special density, pull compensation or underlay settings to suit different fabrics.

## Tension

Tautness of thread when forming stitches. Top thread tension, as well as bobbin thread tension, need to be correctly set. Proper thread tension is achieved when about one third of the thread showing on the underside of the fabric on a column stitch is bobbin thread.

## Textured edge

Use Textured Edge to create rough edges, to create shading effects, or to imitate fur or other fluffy textures in your design.

## Thread

Fine cord or natural or synthetic material made from two or more filaments twisted together and used for stitching. Machine embroidery threads come in rayon (high sheen), cotton (duller finish), polyester (strong and colorfast), metallics (synthetic core wrapped with metal foil or thin slivers of metal foil) and acrylic (sheen similar to rayon).

## Thread Brake functions

Thread Brake +/- functions instruct the machine when to increase or decrease tension one increment by Thread Brake.

## Thread chart

Thread charts are lists of predefined thread colors. They may be based on commercially available thread charts, or charts you define yourself. You can copy colors between different thread charts to create your own charts from existing colors. See also Color palette.

## Thread code

Code is the identification number of a thread color in a brand.

## Thread roller functions

Thread Roller +/- functions instruct the machine when to increase or decrease tension one increment by Thread Roller Feed (2S-55 RCC).

## Thread cutting

The removal of ‘floats’, by hand or by machine.

## Thread density

Different thread density systems are used by different thread manufacturers. Density A is normal embroidery thread (density 120/2, or 40). Density B is thicker, Density C is finer, and Density D is very fine.

## Thread thickness

See Thread density.

## Thread type

Embroidery thread varies in thickness. Types are A, B, C and D. Stitch density should be set according to the thread type. See also Thread thickness.

## Tie-ins

Tie-in stitches are inserted at the start of objects to prevent stitches from unraveling. They are inserted inside the shape on the second stitch. You generally use them when the previous connector is trimmed.

## Tie-offs

Tie-offs are generally placed before trims to prevent stitches from unraveling. You can adjust connector settings to automatically add tie-offs under certain conditions, or add them manually. You can also include trim functions so machines with trimmers cut the thread automatically.

## Title bar

The horizontal bar located at the top of a window and containing the title of the window. On many windows, the title bar also contains the Control menu box and Maximize and Minimize buttons.

## Toolbar

Toolbars provide quick and easy access to EmbroideryStudio commands. Click a toolbar button to activate a command or, where applicable, right-click to view and adjust its settings.

## Topping

Material hooped or placed on top of fabrics that have definable nap or surface texture, such as corduroy and terry cloth, prior to embroidery. The topping compacts the wale or nap and holds the stitches above it. It includes a variety of substances, such as plastic wrap, water-soluble plastic ‘foil’ and open-weave fabric that has been chemically treated to disintegrate with the application of heat. Also known as ‘facing’. See also Stabilizer.

## Trapunto

Trapunto is a general term for open fill stitching, often used as a background or for filling large shapes. In EmbroideryStudio, Trapunto effect forces travel runs to the edges of objects so they do not show through open or loose stitching.

## Travel runs

Travel runs are typically used to connect segments of complex shapes. They can also connect adjacent objects. Because runs are not trimmed, they may be visible in the final embroidery. For this reason, they are less commonly used as connectors between objects than jumps. If objects are adjacent and connectors will be hidden, they can be used.

## Traveling

You generally check a design’s stitching sequence by ‘traveling’ through it by stitches, segments, functions or objects.

## Trim function

If you are using a machine with an automatic trimmer, the trim code causes the thread to be cut after a tie-off. In the software, trims are represented by a triangle with a small circle at the point where stitching starts again. The trimmed connector appears as a dotted line. You can adjust connector settings to automatically add trims, or add them yourself.

## Trimmers

Devices built into an embroidery machine to automatically trim or cut remaining thread when the design jumps from one area to another or performs a color change.

## Trimming

Action of cutting loose thread, removing backing, etc, from the final embroidered product.

## Triple Run stitch

Triple Run repeats each Run stitch three (or more) times for a thick line. Typically used to add borders and pickout runs to designs.

## Triple Satin

Triple Satin is often used for folk designs to mimic handmade embroidery that uses thicker thread. If you require thicker stitches, set the Satin stitch to repeat itself multiple times.

## TrueType font

Digital font technology designed by Apple Computer and now used by both Apple and Microsoft in their operating systems.

## TrueView™

TrueView™ provides you with a preview of how your embroidery will look when stitched out. It gives the screen image a three dimensional look.

## Turning stitches

Embroidery objects can be filled with parallel or turning stitching. Turning stitches are columns of stitches which turn to follow the path defined by the object outline. By contrast, parallel stitching traverses the shape in one direction only – e.g. at 90° to the horizontal, 45°, or whatever is set. Objects can be created with turning stitching already applying, or multiple stitch angles can be added later. Turning stitches are best used with designs containing complicated, turning shapes such as trees, animals, or large filled areas. Turns generally occur at points where a shape changes significantly in direction or width.

## TWAIN

Industry standard which allows devices (such as scanners) to communicate directly with design and layout programs. Both device and program must be TWAIN-compliant. This lets you use any TWAIN-compliant scanner with your software.

## U??

Machine file format native to Barudan machines.

## UDL file

DesignWorkflow uses the Microsoft Data Link (UDL) format to link to its databases. UDL files are similar to MS Windows® shortcuts, but they contain more information about where the actual database and all of its attendant files are located. Copies of UDL files can be shared, renamed and relocated so that many people can use the information. In effect, every user with DesignWorkflow can have their own UDL link to the same database.

## Underlay

Stitches sewn before other design elements to help stabilize fabrics. The stitching action that will attach the backing to the fabric being embroidered. It also supports the top embroidery for a more lofty, dimensional look. Underlay stitches are made up of a series of single run stitches, usually with a very short stitch length, and are digitized manually or placed automatically under the column (satin) or fill stitch areas of your embroidery design.

## Underlay margin

The distance between an object outline and the edge of the underlay. Increase this margin to prevent underlay stitches from extending outside the cover stitches.

## USB-capable embroidery machine

An embroidery machine which has a standard USB port built into the machine or machine control panel.

## USB converter

A device which converts a standard serial connection port to a USB type A connection.

## USB memory stick

Standard USB memory stick or simply ‘USB stick’ used for storing and transporting files.

## USB port

Universal Serial Bus Connector – a connection on a computer where you plug in the dongle.

## User-defined split

User-defined splits add details to filled objects via digitized lines of needle penetrations called ‘split lines’. Split lines are stored as object properties. They are preserved when stitches are regenerated even if you apply a different stitch type.

## Values

The actual settings – letters and numbers – that you enter into dialogs. See also Object Properties.

## Variable sizing

Ability to scale a design to different sizes.

## Variable stitch length

The software can automatically calculate the best length for each stitch with the Variable Run Length option. A chord gap value controls how closely the stitches follow the digitized lines.

## VDT

VDT is a Hiraoka Schiffli format.

## Vector graphic

Unlike raster images, vector graphics contain vector data. This is a collection of geometric shapes and lines that combine to make an image. Rather than pixels, such data is recorded as a set of mathematical formulas defining shapes such as rectangles, ellipses, curves, polygon stars, etc. These are created using vector graphics programs such as CorelDRAW® Graphics Suite. Vector graphics are scalable without distortion, and are usually much smaller than bitmap images. See also Bitmap image.

## Vector object

Vector objects are derived from vector graphics and can be created in EmbroideryStudio or imported. In EmbroideryStudio they can be converted to and from embroidery objects. You can set general properties such as size and position, and arrange and transform them in the same way as other objects. See also Vector graphics.

## Vector text

A text object created using the CorelDRAW® Graphics Suite Text tool.

## VEP

Hiraoka VEP file format is used extensively for Pattern Arrangements (ABC) on existing machines. VEP uses a small arrangement file which splits the different design parts – A is one file, B is a second file, C is a third file.

## Watcher

The operator of the Schiffli machine who sets the pattern, twists the yarns, maintains the shuttles, loads and unloads the machines, performs the rollovers and watches for thread and needle breakage. The machine operator.

## Wave Effect

With Wave Effect you can curve Closed Fill stitches along a digitized line to create flowing stitch effects. The stitches follow the digitized line but maintain uniform density and needle penetration patterns.

## Weave stitch

See Tatami stitch.

## WECS

WECS (Wilcom ElectroCard System) eliminates the need for Jacquard cards. WECS reads Wilcom machine files T10 and T15 and runs the Schiffli Automat directly. You therefore only need to save the design as a machine file to floppy disk.

## Weight

When referring to T-shirts, the three standard weight divisions are mid-weight/value, heavyweight/premium, and super heavyweight.

## WESS

WESS (Wilcom Electronic Servo System) replaces the Schiffli Automat and controls the frame movements directly by servo motors. It requires Wilcom ESS, Hiraoka DAT, Saurer SAS, T10 or T15 files on floppy disk as input and its method of operation is similar to WECS.

## WIA

Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) is the still image acquisition platform in the Windows family of operating systems starting with Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me) and Windows XP.

## WiFi device

Device capable of connecting to a WiFi Router or wireless access point.

## WiFi network name (SSID)

Service Set Identifier (SSID) – the unique identifier attached to the information which is sent over a wireless local area network.

## WiFi password (key)

Password, passphrase or key (depending on the WiFi security type) that allows connection to the WiFi router or access point.

## WiFi router

Device that provides basic network infrastructure for a home or small office network. Provides a wireless access point for many wireless devices to connect to each other for access to the Internet as well as for file sharing and printing. Sometimes referred to simply as a Wireless Router.

## WiFi USB machine network

A network of wirelessly connected, USB enabled embroidery machines and PCs.

## Windows domain

a network of Windows PCs, also known as ‘network domain’, in which computers rely on a centralized authentication database. Users log into the domain and the access privileges are served from the central database which is controlled by a network administrator.

## Windows workgroup

‘Workgroup’ is Microsoft’s term for a peer-to-peer local area network. Computers running Microsoft operating systems in the same workgroup may share files, printers, or Internet connection.

## Wireless Access Point (WAP)

A wireless access point or ‘WAP’ is a hardware device on a local area network (LAN) that allows wireless capable devices and wired networks to connect.

## WLAN

Wireless Local Area Network or WiFi network.

## WMF

MS Windows® Metafile vector format.

## Write

To send design information to an embroidery disk, design card or embroidery machine for immediate stitchout or storage.

## X/Y coordinates

The horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) distances on a graph or computer screen. Use X values to measure width, and Y values to measure height.

## XXX

Compucon stitch or ‘expanded’ file format in the professional market.

## Zigzag stitch

Zigzag stitch is similar to Satin but is generally used where fewer stitches are required. The needle penetrates each side of the column, laying the thread across in an open zigzag pattern. The density is determined by the stitch spacing setting. The settings for Zigzag fill stitches are stored separately from Zigzag and Double Zigzag underlay settings.

## Zigzag underlay

Zigzag and Double Zigzag underlay stitching is used to support wide columns.

## Zoom factor

The scale at which the design is currently displayed.

## ZSK

ZSK1 format is for older ZSK machines, generally those older than 1991\. ZSK2 is for newer ZSK machines, those characterized by a single top thread trimmer. The trim is the most significant differentiating factor between the two types.
