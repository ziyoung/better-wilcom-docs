A color block corresponds to a [color stop](../../glossary/glossary) in the design. It may contain a single object or group of like-objects – e.g. ‘ropes’. Or it may be comprised of different objects of like-color – e.g. ‘ropes and birds’. The Color-Object List offers an easy way to selectively view [color blocks](../../glossary/glossary) and embroidery objects. The View by Color function also lets you view objects by color. The Colorway Editor provides another method for selective viewing of color blocks.

## To view selected color blocks...

- Click the Color-Object List icon. The Color-Object List can be docked to the either side of the design window, or floated in any position.
- Click the switch to view the list by color block.
