# Set up multiple views

EmbroideryStudio gives you multiple views of the same design. It also allows you to switch between open designs by means of design tabs. This also makes it easy to copy/paste between designs, including drag and drop operations.

## To set up multiple views...

- Use the Window menu commands to set up groups of tabs as preferred.
