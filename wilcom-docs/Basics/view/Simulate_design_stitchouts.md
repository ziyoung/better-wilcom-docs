Stitch Player is an important tool in EmbroideryStudio. It lets you simulate the actual embroidery design stitchout on screen. Because Stitch Player emulates the movements of the embroidery machine, you are able to make decisions about how to optimize your design in order to lessen the load on the machine. This is important if you intend to make multiple stitchouts.

- Optionally, use the slider bar to move the starting point.
- Use the controls to stitch forwards or backwards through the design. Typical ‘media player’ buttons are available for play, pause, rewind operations.
- Use the Auto Pause control to set stop points – by color change, stop, or trim.
- To redraw a section of design, specify a start and end stitch using the tabs.
