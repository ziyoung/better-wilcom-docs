# Viewing design components

EmbroideryStudio provides many viewing modes to make it easier to work with your design. View a design at actual size or zoom in for more details. Pan across instead of scrolling, or quickly change between current and previous views.

Note: You need to calibrate your monitor so that designs at 1:1 scale appear at real size. Do this when you first install EmbroideryStudio or whenever you change your monitor. Go to Setup > Calibrate Screen.
