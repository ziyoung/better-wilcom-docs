# Viewing stitching sequence

When checking embroidery designs, you will want to understand the stitching sequence in order to ensure efficient stitchout on the machine. ‘Travel’ through designs by [color block](../../glossary/glossary), [embroidery object](../../glossary/glossary), or even stitch-by-stitch. Alternatively, simulate the stitchout on screen.

Tip: Depending on your design background, you can change display colors for unsewn stitches. [See Change display colors for details.](Change_display_colors)
