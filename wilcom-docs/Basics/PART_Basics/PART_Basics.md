Embroidery design in EmbroideryStudio consists of turning basic artwork shapes into embroidery objects. EmbroideryStudio allows you to create embroidery objects with artwork as backdrops or by directly converting digital artwork. You can take a mixed mode approach as well, doing the bulk of the design by means of automatic conversion, followed by touch-ups and edits using the suite of EmbroideryStudio digitizing tools.
