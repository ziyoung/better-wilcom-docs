The Color-Object List offers an easy way to select objects and selectively view them. It is synchronized with the design window, dynamically updating whenever you edit.

## To select objects by Color-Object List...

- Click the Color-Object List icon to open the docker. A separate icon for each [color block](../../glossary/glossary) and each object in the design appears in order of stitching.
