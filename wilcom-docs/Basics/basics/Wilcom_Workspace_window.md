When you open EmbroideryStudio, it appears by default in Wilcom Workspace window with a new, blank design displayed. This mode allows you to create and edit [embroidery objects](../../glossary/glossary) using the embroidery [digitizing](../../glossary/glossary) toolset. The screen image below shows the more prominent toolbars in EmbroideryStudio. Depending on your product level, you will have access to some or all of these options.

Use this mode when you want to create embroidery from digitizing ‘[backdrops](../../glossary/glossary)’. Various types of image file can be loaded in EmbroideryStudio. Wilcom Workspace also offers a graphical representation of what the final embroidery will look like. Use TrueView™ together with a background fabric to see how your design will look when stitched out. Some of the more prominent Wilcom Workspace interface elements include:
