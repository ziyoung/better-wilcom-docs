CorelDRAW Graphics window includes the entire suite of CorelDRAW® Graphics Suite drawing tools. This mode allows you to create and edit [vector](../../glossary/glossary) graphics using the CorelDRAW Graphics toolset which offers many sophisticated techniques for drafting outlines and shapes onscreen.

In addition to the CorelDRAW® Graphics Suite toolset, CorelDRAW Graphics provides capabilities to convert [vectors](../../glossary/glossary) and vector text directly to [embroidery objects](../../glossary/glossary). Imported vector graphics or created text can be converted directly to embroidery designs. You can use CorelDRAW Graphics to insert or paste third-party vector graphics such as clipart for use in embroidery designs. Alternatively, insert, paste or scan [bitmap](../../glossary/glossary) artwork for use as digitizing templates or ‘[backdrops](../../glossary/glossary)’. Here are some of the prominent CorelDRAW Graphics interface elements.
