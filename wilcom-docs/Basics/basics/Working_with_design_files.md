EmbroideryStudio handles all commercial and home stitch file formats. In fact native EMB files are read and written by leading home embroidery systems.

Whenever you start EmbroideryStudio, a new file – Design1 – is automatically created. By default, Design1 is based on the NORMAL template. Templates contain preset styles, [default settings](../../glossary/glossary) or objects, to make digitizing quicker and easier. EmbroideryStudio also provides a set of optimized [fabric](../../glossary/glossary) settings so that the software will take into account the type of fabric you are stitching on.
