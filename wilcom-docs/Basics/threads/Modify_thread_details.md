You can copy colors from other charts or mix them yourself. You can also set the code, description, brand, and thickness of existing threads. Remove obsolete thread colors for good housekeeping.

## To modify thread details...

- Select Setup > Manage Thread Charts. Alternatively, click the Select Thread Charts button in the Colorway Editor and click Manage.

- Enter code, name, and chart for the thread color.

Code is the identification number of a thread color in a brand.

- Select the appropriate thread thickness. These values are added to or subtracted from values used in the [Auto Spacing](../../glossary/glossary) table for specific stitch lengths.

| Thickness | Description                                  | Default |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| A         | Normal embroidery thread (approx. denier 40) | 0.01    |
| B         | Thicker than normal (approx. denier 30)      | 0.03    |
| C         | Finer than normal (approx. denier 80)        | \-0.03  |
| D         | Very fine (approx. denier 100)               | \-0.06  |

::: tip
Lighter weight threads do not run so well in a production environment as the machines need to be slowed down in order to avoid thread breaks. However, lighter weight threads are good for very small lettering and fine-detail designs.
