The supplied charts represent the brands of threads that EmbroideryStudio supports. Each chart includes a range of thread colors together with code, brand and description. You can search for a thread by code or description and assign it to a selected design color slot. Alternatively, let the software match design colors to threads in the current thread chart/s.

## To assign thread colors...

- Press Esc to deselect all objects. The currently selected (default) color is shown in the toolbar.

- Use the scrollbar to refine your search. Or, in the Search field, enter the first few characters of the required code or name. The code is the identification number of a thread color in a brand. The system searches for the closest match and displays it in the thread color list.
- Double-click or click Assign Thread to assign a thread to the current color slot in the current colorway.
- Alternatively, use Match All to assign threads from the current chart/s to all color slots in the current colorway.
- Check the thread assignments in the Color toolbar by hovering the pointer over the slots.
- Optionally, click Remove Unused Colors to remove unused colors.

::: info Note
The Remove Unused Colors tool is disabled for machine formats that use [needle addressing](../../glossary/glossary#needle-addressing) â€“ i.e. that have Color Change set as Needle No in the Machine Format Settings dialog.
