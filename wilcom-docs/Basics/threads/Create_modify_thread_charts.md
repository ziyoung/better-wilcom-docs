EmbroideryStudio lets you define your own charts. When you create a thread chart, you are creating a store of colors for future use. Select names that will help you remember the charts or help you sort frequently-used charts to the top of the list. Rename or remove charts at any time.

## To create a new thread chart...

- Select Manage Thread Charts via the Setup menu. Alternatively, click the Select Thread Charts button in the Colorway Editor.
