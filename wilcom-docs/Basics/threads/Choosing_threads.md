# Choosing threads

The [color palette ](../../glossary/glossary)contains a selection of colors tailored to each design or colorway. New objects are created using the currently selected color. You can change colors at any stage. [Machine functions](../../glossary/glossary) are automatically inserted in the stitching sequence whenever you assign a color. Typically you will want to assign actual thread colors to the Color toolbar in these circumstances...

- When you create a design, it includes a single default [colorway](../../glossary/glossary). Using the NORMAL template, ‘Colorway 1’ contains default colors, unassigned to any thread chart.
- When you convert vector graphics in CorelDRAW Graphics, colors are appended to the color palette as unassigned RGB values (if Match to Embroidery Palette is off).
- When you use the Color Wheel to create new color combinations, RGB values are added to the color palette.
- When you auto-digitize a bitmap, RGB values can be automatically matched to actual threads or simply added to the color palette.
- If you read a machine file, unassigned colors will be appended to the color palette.
- If you receive a design which uses colors from a thread chart you don’t have, you may want to match them to a preferred thread chart.

In EmbroideryStudio you can search for threads in one or several charts and assign them manually or automatically.

Note: Due to the differences in computer monitors and computer video cards, the approximate colors displayed should be used only as guides. Threads should always be matched to the appropriate physical color card.
