# Using automatic connectors

EmbroideryStudio lets you generate automatic [connectors](../../glossary/glossary#connectors) based on settings in the Object Properties > Connectors docker. You can change connector settings for a whole design or selected objects. If you prefer to add tie-offs and trims as you digitize, you can turn off automatic connectors altogether. For Schiffli work, you are advised to add connectors manually rather than rely on the automatic settings. Automatic connectors are turned off in the Schiffli template. [See Adding connectors manually for details.](Adding_connectors_manually)

::: tip
The Branching feature lets you digitize like-objects – e.g. the fingers of a hand – without having to think about the most efficient stitching sequence and joins. [See Automatic branching for details.](Automatic_branching)
