Note: The function is only available if more than one object of any suitable type is selected.

2. Click the Branching icon. EmbroideryStudio will prompt you to digitize entry and [exit points](../../glossary/glossary).

3. Digitize entry and exit points, or press Enter twice to accept the [defaults](../../glossary/glossary).

Component objects are grouped and share the color of the first branched object. Objects are resequenced, [connectors](../../glossary/glossary) minimized, and stitches regenerated.
