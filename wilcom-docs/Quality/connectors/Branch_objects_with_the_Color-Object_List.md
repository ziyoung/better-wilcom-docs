Note: The function is only available if more than one object of any suitable type is selected.

4Digitize entry and [exit points](../../glossary/glossary), or press Enter twice to accept the [defaults](../../glossary/glossary).

Component objects are grouped and share the color of the first branched object. Objects are resequenced, [connectors](../../glossary/glossary) minimized, and stitches regenerated.
