You can add trims in your design using the Trim tool. When you add a trim in this way, the trim function is added to the current stitch. Some machines require [empty stitches](../../glossary/glossary) or [empty jumps](../../glossary/glossary) on either side of the trim. If this is the case for the machine you want to stitch to, you will need to insert them.

Tip: Make sure that all stitches you trim have been tied in and off, otherwise stitches will not be secured.

## To add a trim...

1Travel to the needle position where you want to trim the thread.

2Click the Insert Trim icon. A trim function is inserted at the current needle position.
