# Adding connectors manually

You can add tie-offs and trims to a design manually using the Tie Off, Trim and Empty Stitch tools. While generally not recommended and less efficient than using automatic [connectors](../../glossary/glossary#connectors), this method does give you more control over the final design. For example, some [machine formats](../../glossary/glossary) are unable to read functions that appear on a normal stitch. For these machines, you need to add trim, tie-off and other [machine functions](../../glossary/glossary) to an Empty Stitch or Empty Jump. You may also need to add one or more [empty stitches](../../glossary/glossary) or [empty jumps](../../glossary/glossary) to either side of a function for the machine to read it correctly.

::: info Note
For Schiffli work, you are advised to add connectors manually rather than rely on the automatic settings. Automatic connectors are turned off by default in the Schiffli template.
