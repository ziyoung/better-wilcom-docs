![BranchingInputA.png](assets/BranchingInputA.png)Because Branching combines objects to form a single branched object, you may be able to apply a single underlay to the entire object. The technique works well with Column A or Column B objects.

## To apply automatic underlay to branched objects...

1. Select the branched object and right-click Auto Underlay.

2. Select the First Underlay checkbox and select an underlay type.

3. Optionally, add a second underlay.

4. Press Enter or click Apply. Underlay stitches are automatically generated for the branched object.

::: info Note
If component objects are touching or overlapping, the underlay is first stitched out for the whole branched object followed by the cover stitch.
