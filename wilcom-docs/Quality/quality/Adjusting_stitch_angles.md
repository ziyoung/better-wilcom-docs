# Adjusting stitch angles

Stitch angle adjustments depend on object type. With [Complex Fill](../../glossary/glossary) objects you can set a single stitch angle for the entire object. You can add multiple stitch angles with the Stitch Angles tool. You can also adjust stitch angles with the Reshape Object tool.
