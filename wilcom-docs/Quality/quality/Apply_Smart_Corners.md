Use the Smart Corners feature to reduce the number of stitches and risk of bunched, distorted embroidery in sharp corners. Mitre Corners creates a sharp line at the intersection of two columns. Use it primarily for corner angles of 20° to 45°. Cap Corners is suitable for very sharp corners as it generates fewer stitches. Lap Corners is suitable for ‘Tidori’ style stitching. It can be applied to [Column C](../../glossary/glossary) and appliqué objects.
