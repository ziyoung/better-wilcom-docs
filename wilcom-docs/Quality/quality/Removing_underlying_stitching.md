- In the Cutters panel, adjust minimum object width and maximum stitch spacing as desired.

These settings are useful if, for example, you choose an entire design as a cutter and wish to exclude objects, such as borders or details, less than a certain width. The Maximum Stitch Spacing setting allows you to exclude background stitches of a certain density.

- Select Accordion Allowed to include Accordion Spacing objects. By default, the software treats these objects as backgrounds and excludes them from the cutting operation.
- Enter the amount of overlap required in the Cutting Overlaps field.

- In the Minimum Fragments field, enter the size of the smallest object that will be produced after cutting. This eliminates the generation of small objects and unnecessary color changes.
- Click OK. Underlaying stitching is removed.
