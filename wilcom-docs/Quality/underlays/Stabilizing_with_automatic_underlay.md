# Stabilizing with automatic underlay

Embroidery appearance and quality depends a lot on [underlay](../../glossary/glossary) which serves as a foundation for the cover stitching. Without an underlay, embroidery lies flat on the underlying fabric which can often show through. New digitizers might be tempted to increase stitch density but it is much more effective to apply an automatic underlay. Although it increases the stitch count, underlay helps to stabilize fabrics and reduce puckering and pulling especially on larger designs. It also provides ‘loft’, raising cover stitches and preventing them from sinking into soft fabrics. It can also prepare a napped fabric by flattening it.
