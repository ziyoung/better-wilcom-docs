By default EmbroideryStudio saves designs to its native EMB format. This contains all information necessary both for stitching a design and for later modification. The Design Library conversion function allows you to batch-convert to and from all EMB and other supported design file types. It also batch-converts many machine file formats such as DST, EXP, SEW.

## To convert designs...

- Select the file(s) to be converted and click the Convert Selected Designs icon. The dialog lists all machine file formats supports by the software.
