EmbroideryStudio supports various machine models. Some can be connected by cable directly to your PC via USB port. Others require files to be placed in a specific network location or ‘watching folder’. Older-style machines do not support direct connection but they do read ATA PC cards and/or USB memory sticks. Connection Manager provides a method of connection to machines that appear as removable media or make use of third-party connection software. Once set up in EmbroideryStudio, a single click is sufficient to send the design to machine.

::: info Note
You can only send one design at a time via Connection Manager.
