# Locating designs in the library

Design Library is a ‘virtual library’ in that any designs on your system can be located and displayed within the navigation pane. The Design Library doesn’t care where they physically reside on your hard disk, local network, or external storage devices. Any folder containing embroidery designs can be included in the navigation pane.
