| Option               | Function                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Approval sheet       | This is intended for the customer, not production staff. Customers can see what they are ordering and approve accordingly.                                                                        |
| Production worksheet | This is intended for production staff. All production-related information, such as bobbin length, design size, garment fabric, etc, is provided.                                                  |
| Production summary   | This provides two summary tables of the design and associated colorways – a Colorway Summary together with a Design Summary.                                                                      |
| Appliqué patterns    | This shows appliqué patterns – cutter information – isolated from the design. These can be used as a guide to cutting out fabric pieces. They also show which appliqué pieces are to be included. |
| Color film           | Provides a list of colors in the design, together with color and stitch information for each color layer. This helps the machine operator to see each stitch color in order of stitchout.         |

- The Worksheet type panel provides options for further customization.
- Click OK and ensure correct printer settings in the MS Windows® Print Setup dialog. The dialog and the settings available vary from printer to printer. See your printer manual for details.
