| Navigation pane           | The navigation pane in the Design Library is not an exact duplicate of your File Explorer folder structure. It is selective in that it only contains folders relevant to embroidery design and multi-decoration. Select and add any folder on your PC or network to view supported file types.                                                                              |
| Design display area       | The design display area shows any designs in selected folders corresponding to the filter selected or search criteria entered in the View (Design Library) toolbar. Use the toolbar to filter the design display. Right-click selected designs to access a popup menu. Use it to cut, copy and delete without leaving the software. Use it also to zip designs and folders. |
| Details pane              | When a design is selected, summary information is displayed in the preview pane.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
