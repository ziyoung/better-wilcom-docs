# Custom asset locations

Custom data – including custom fabrics, templates, motifs, borders, and fonts – is stored in dedicated folders. In EmbroideryStudio, custom locations divide into two broad categories – program data and user data.

Note: Some data folders will only be created when the software is opened for the first time after restarting your system.

## Program data

Program data is written the Windows ‘ProgramData’ folder whenever you modify a standard EmbroideryStudio asset such as auto fabrics. This folder is located here: C:\\ProgramData\\Wilcom\\EmbroideryStudio. Asset files are then located in the following sub-folders...

| Custom asset    | Location              | File types            |
| --------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Auto fabrics    | ..\\RES\\AutoFabric   | userdefined.autost    |
| Backup files    | ..\\BACKUP            | \*.EMB                |
| Borders         | ..\\BORDERS           | \*.ESA                |
| Carving stamps  | ..\\STAMPS            | \*.ESA                |

| Recovery files  | ..\\RECOVER           | \*.EMA                |
| Styles          | ..\\TEMPLATE          | \*.EMT                |
| Templates       | ..\\TEMPLATE          | \*.EMT                |
| Thread charts   | ..\\RES\\ThreadCharts | \*.TCH                |

## Embroidery data

Embroidery data includes any design or machine files. Theoretically, this data can be housed anywhere on your network. By default, it is installed here: C:\\Users\\Public\\Public Embroidery. Files are then classified into the following sub-folders...

| Custom asset       | Location                                                   | File types                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Embroidery designs | ..\\EmbroideryStudio e4                                    | \*.EMB, \*.ART, \*.JAN, etc |
| Machine files      | ..\\Machine Files                                          | \*.DST, \*.U??, \*.TAP, etc |
| Monogram templates | ..\\EmbroideryStudio e4\\Monogram Template Designs\\Custom | \*.EMB                      |
| Teamname teams     | ..\\EmbroideryStudio e4\\Teamname Teams                    | \*.TXT                      |
| Teamname templates | ..\\EmbroideryStudio e4\\Teamname Template Designs\\Custom | \*.EMB                      |

## Image data

Image data includes any artwork files. Theoretically, this data can be housed anywhere on your network. By default, it is installed here: C:\\Users\\Public\\Pictures. Files are then classified into the following sub-folders...

| Custom asset    | Location                | File types                                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Artwork         | ..\\EmbroideryStudio e4 | \*.JPG, \*.BMP, \*.PNG, \*.CDR, \*.AI, \*.EPS, etc |
| Fabric patterns | ..\\Fabrics             | \*.JPG, \*.BMP                                     |

## Product backdrops

EmbroideryStudio allows you to choose a garment or product backdrop on which to position decorations. The Product Visualizer feature is used to display location, size and overall appearance for visualization and customer approval purposes. You can add your own single-color and multi-color product templates to the software. [See Product Visualizer Templates for details.](../product_templates/Product_Visualizer_Templates)

As assets, product backdrops fall between the stools. They are PNG artwork files but they are considered ‘program data’. They have their own dedicated location here:

C:\\Program Files\\Wilcom\\EmbroideryStudio\\Products
