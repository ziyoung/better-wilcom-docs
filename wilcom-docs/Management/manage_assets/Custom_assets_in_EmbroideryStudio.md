| Assets             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Embroidery designs | The built-in Design Library makes it easy to search, sort and browse all embroidery designs on your network. Any folder containing embroidery designs can be included in the navigation tree. [See Design Management for details.](../manage_designs/Design_Management)                   |
| Machine files      | Similarly, the Design Library makes it easy to search, sort and browse all machine files on your system. [See Design Management for details.](../manage_designs/Design_Management)                                                                                                        |
| Artwork            | Artwork files may also be managed with the Design Library. Sample files are installed by default to the standard Windows ‘Pictures’ library. [See Design Management for details.](../manage_designs/Design_Management)                                                                    |
| Recovery files     | The Auto Save function creates a temporary file with the extension EMA in the RECOVER folder. This is automatically restored when EmbroideryStudio is restarted after a computer crash. You can access these files manually by browsing to the folder and renaming files from EMA to EMB. |
| Backup files       | If the Backup Copy option is activated, a backup copy of the current design file is automatically created in its previously saved form. The backup copy is saved in the BACKUP folder with the original file name and native file format.                                                 |

## Design presets

| Assets           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Design templates | Templates are special files used to store fabrics, objects and default settings. Use templates when digitizing frequently-used design types so that you do not have to adjust current settings every time. [See Working with templates for details.](../../Digitizing/properties/Working_with_templates)                                                                                        |
| Styles           | A style is a group of property settings stored under a unique name. This makes it easy to apply them to selected embroidery and lettering objects. Define new styles for a design template, either from scratch or based on an existing style or object. [See Working with styles for details.](../../Digitizing/properties/Working_with_styles)                                                |
| Auto fabrics     | Normally you choose a fabric when you start a design although you can change it at any stage. Fabric settings affect all object types other than motif fills, appliqué, and run stitches. In addition to predefined fabric settings, you can create your own custom fabrics to suit particular needs. [See Working with fabrics for details.](../../Digitizing/properties/Working_with_fabrics) |

## Lettering assets

| Assets             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fonts              | EmbroideryStudio provides methods for defining custom and ‘user-refined’ embroidery fonts. You can digitize letters from backdrop images, convert vector objects, or digitize freehand using any of the input method tools. [See Custom Lettering for details.](../../Lettering/lettering_custom/Custom_Lettering)                                                                                                                                    |
| Monogram templates | You build monograms using the Monogramming docker. The simplest way to get started is to select a monogram template from the Designs tab. The Custom folder contains your custom templates. [See Monogram designs for details.](../../Lettering/lettering_monograms/Monogram_designs)                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Teamname teams     | A teamname design may include names from predefined teams which can be used any number of times. You can even combine members from different teams. [See Managing teams for details.](../../Lettering/lettering_names/Managing_teams)                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Teamname templates | When creating teamname designs, you can use a preset layout or a custom layout based on artwork you may have received. Typically, you will receive a brief and possibly artwork from a customer. This design can be saved for reuse as a teamname template. [See Create custom templates for details.](../../Lettering/lettering_names/Create_custom_templates)                                                                                       |
| Kiosk templates    | EmbroideryStudio provides an easy-to-use lettering ‘kiosk’ capability for cap and other embroidery. The kiosk is primarily intended for retail outlets where fast and simple personalization is required. The kiosk provides a set of predefined design layouts. You can create your own layouts for use in the kiosk. The default banner can also be customized. [See Lettering Kiosk for details.](../../Lettering/lettering_kiosk/Lettering_Kiosk) |

## Stitch presets

| Assets         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Motifs         | Motif stamps are ready-made design elements, such as hearts, leaves or geometric patterns which are contained in libraries or ‘sets’. You can define your own stamps for individual use or for use in motif runs or fills. [See Custom motifs for details.](../../Decorative/motifs/Custom_motifs)                                    |
| Program splits | Program Split is a decorative fill stitch where needle penetrations form a tiled pattern. Make your own patterns to use in Program Split fills. The same patterns can also be used with Flexi Split effects. [See Creating patterns with custom splits for details.](../../Decorative/patterns/Creating_patterns_with_custom_splits)  |
| Carving stamps | The Carving Stamp feature allows you to select object outlines from the design window and apply them directly as stamps or save them to a library for future reference. You can use vector or embroidery objects as a basis for stamps. [See Add stamps to a library for details.](../../Decorative/patterns/Add_stamps_to_a_library) |

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hoops           | The software allows you to define your own hoops and save for later use or associate with a custom machine type. Custom hoops are needed because new hoops become available for sewing machines more frequently than the software is updated. [See Creating custom hoops for details.](../../Production/hoops/Creating_custom_hoops)                                                 |
| Machine formats | EmbroideryStudio provides standard formats for most machines. However, if your machine is different, you may need to customize the machine format settings. [See Custom machine formats for details.](../../Setup/machines/Custom_machine_formats)                                                                                                                                   |
| Products        | EmbroideryStudio lets you choose a garment or product backdrop on which to position your decoration. Use it to display location, size and overall appearance for visualization and approval purposes. It is possible to create custom product backdrops for use in your business. [See Product Visualizer Templates for details.](../product_templates/Product_Visualizer_Templates) |
| Thread charts   | The thread charts contained in the software represent the many different brands and colors of thread available. You can modify thread charts to reflect the threads you are currently using. You can even create your own. [See Create & modify thread charts for details.](../../Basics/threads/Create_modify_thread_charts)                                                        |
