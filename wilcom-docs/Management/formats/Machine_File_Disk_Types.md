# Machine, File & Disk Types

This section provides details of the file and disk types supported by EmbroideryStudio. Details are also provided about the conversion of Melco CND, Wilcom INP, and Gunold PCH design formats to and from [EMB](../../glossary/glossary). The section also provides details of vector and bitmap (raster) formats.

In conjunction with CorelDRAWÂ® Graphics Suite, EmbroideryStudio reads and writes a wide variety of related and sometimes complementary decoration processes or techniques. [See also Exporting multiple decoration files.](../../Applied/export/Exporting_multiple_decoration_files)

Note: There are many additional Schiffli file formats to suit specific Schiffli machines. EmbroideryStudio supports the most important of these. See the ES Schiffli User Manual Supplement for details.
