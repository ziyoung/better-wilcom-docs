# Supported machine types

The table shows the machine types supported by EmbroideryStudio. Make sure you first check the recommended connection settings for your particular machine. If you donâ€™t have a record of the connection settings required to set up your embroidery machine, a list can be found at the Wilcom Support Center. This provides connection information for all the machines listed in this table. [See Hardware Settings for details.](../../Setup/hardware/Hardware_Settings)
