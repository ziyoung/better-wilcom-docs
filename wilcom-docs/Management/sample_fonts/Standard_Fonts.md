## Non-Roman fonts

Non-Roman character fonts include:

- [Cyrillic fonts](Non-Roman_fonts)
- [Hebrew fonts](Non-Roman_fonts)
- [Japanese fonts](Non-Roman_fonts)

## Minimum & maximum sizes

For best results when stitching, do not exceed the recommended maximum or minimum sizes. Note, however, that recommended maximum and minimum heights refer to UPPER CASE letters. Most embroidery fonts are digitized from an original TrueType Font (TTF), some of which have lower-case letters – e.g. ‘a’ and ‘c’ – which are about 70% the height of a capital letter. As a result, these letters may be too small to embroider neatly. You may need to increase the size of the lower-case characters to suit the embroidery.

## Special characters

You can create special characters in each font by holding down the Alt key on your keyboard and typing 0 (zero), its code, using the numbers on the keypad. For example, to type ê with the code 234, type Alt+0234. The accented letter will appear when you release the Alt key.

Note: Not all characters are available in all fonts.

## Join method

The lettering join method is preset to give the best results for each font. Options include:
