# Set transparency

Because you want product images to display correctly on any color background, you need to make the image background transparent. Make sure anti-aliasing is activated. Image edges will appear smoother. The transparent background usually appears as a gray checker pattern. If you are using Corel PhotoPaint, follow these steps…

## To set the transparency...

1Choose Magic Wand Mask.

5Click Invert Mask. The garment alone will be selected.
