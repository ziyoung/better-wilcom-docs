# Save your layers

Once you have finished separating the photo into different layers, you will need to save each as a separate file and copy all resulting files in a particular folder.

## File format

Each layer must be saved in PNG format. If you have worked your layers correctly, each will have a transparent background that usually appears as a gray checker pattern.

## File naming

Naming conventions:

- Layer1 file name needs to take the form ‘FileName.png’ – e.g. ‘Vest.png’.
- Layer2 file name takes the form ‘FileName2.png’ – e.g. ‘Vest2.png’.
- Layer3 file name takes the form ‘FileName3.png’ – e.g. ‘Vest3.png’.

Note: The first name doesn’t need a number and will be name that identifies the garment in Product Visualizer.
