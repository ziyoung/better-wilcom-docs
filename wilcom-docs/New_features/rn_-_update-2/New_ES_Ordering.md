# New ES Ordering

New ES Ordering is a low-cost product which allows all relevant people in a company to access the Order Job Feature and Design Library. It comes with a range of features to help improve your customer service and sales processes. It allows customer service personnel to quickly find customer designs by order status, and add notes for production or tracking purposes, all without the need for a database. In addition, minor changes to colors can be made on-the-fly. Essentially it gives you all the capabilities of TrueSizer Pro together with the full Design Library and Order Job Feature.

## Software security

ES Ordering does not require a hardware dongle like other ES e4 products. It uses a convenient ‘software dongle’ for software protection similar to TrueSizer Pro. You obtain a ‘Product Key’ when you purchase ES Ordering and activate the software on your PC via an Internet connection. Once activated, you do not require an Internet connection to run the software. This makes it very convenient especially for laptop computer users.
