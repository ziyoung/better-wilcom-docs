Color reduction has been improved for auto-digitizing logo type artwork with the aim of providing more accurate shapes for stitching. A new color-reduction method for logo style designs produces more reliable and predictable color reduction in ‘solid color’ designs. Unwanted edge artifacts are avoided with more complete removal of anti-aliasing effects. There have also been improvements in the treatment of gradient colors, including an option to remove/replace all gradients with solid colors.
