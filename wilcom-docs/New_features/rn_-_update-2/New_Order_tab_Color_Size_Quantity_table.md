# New Order tab Color/Size/Quantity table

The Order tab in the Design Properties docker includes a number of improvements. Order information is saved directly with the design file. This allows embroidery orders to be managed via the designs they use without the need for a commercial database. The information is included on approval sheets. [See also Managing quotes & orders.](../../Management/manage_designs/Managing_quotes_orders)
