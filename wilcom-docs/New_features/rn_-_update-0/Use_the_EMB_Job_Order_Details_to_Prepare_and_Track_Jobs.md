# Use the EMB Job Order Details to Prepare and Track Jobs

Embroidery sales and customer service staff can prepare and manage quotations and orders:

- create new design requests and enter job Order details in new or existing designs
- determine stitch estimates to help determine pricing for quotations
- display the artwork or digitized design on the product to be embroidered
- email Approval Sheets for design and quotation for an order/job to customers for approval
- track the status of designs and customer approvals
- release approved jobs for digitizing and/or production

Digitizing managers and staff can plan and manage digitizing designs:

- know what new designs to create or existing designs to modify by customer, order, date
- track and manage the internal checking status of newly digitized or modified designs
- track and manage previous and new designs by customer, order, date and other job details

Production managers and staff can plan and manage production jobs:

- know when a new design / order is approved for production

## Basic Job Order Details Stored in EMB File Properties

The order / Job details can be entered via the Design Library or the Design Properties dialog inside EmbroideryStudio. Basic order details are stored as EMB file properties. Any alphanumeric information can be entered. Fields include:

## Job Order Detail is standard in all ES Product Models

All products in the EmbroideryStudio family of products (ES) include the Design Library and job order details as standard. Small shops would typically use ES Decorating for most staff. Digitizing staff would use either ES Decorating or ES Designing depending on the amount of digitizing they do. Customer service staff could use lower cost ES Lettering. Production Staff are better suited to ES Editing.
