# Improved traditional digitizing

Traditional style digitizing is standard in ES Designing, and ES Digitizing products. It is not available in ES Decorating. Graphics style digitizing is also provided, so you can use both as desired.

## What do we mean by traditional style of digitizing?

The traditional style of digitizing is different from typical graphics design programs:

- Separate sets of input tools for outlines, for fills
- Explicit selection of which object / calculation method is used
- Emphasis on digitizing shapes with corner and curve points – limited standard shapes
- Prompts for additional input for each object.

The traditional style of digitizing has evolved to follow historical embroidery digitizing practices:

- Experienced digitizers can digitize faster and with greater control
- Newcomers can master it also but require more time to learn.

## Prompt for additional input for each object

Traditional digitizing tools prompt for additional input for multiple boundaries (holes), stitch angles, and start and end points for each object. Pressing Enter will bypass an input and take the default value if desired. This approach has the advantages of:

- More control for the professional who wants to decide the best for each object
- Much quicker to specify when digitizing the shape than coming back to edit it with other tools.

## Simplified set of traditional digitizing tools

EmbroideryStudio e4 has a simplified and rationalized set of traditional digitizing tools, re-named more consistently.

- 1 dedicated Run Tool for digitizing running stitches - whether decorative or travel runs
- With Backtrack and Repeat tools beside for quick access
- 3 traditional ‘Column Fill’ digitizing tools:
- Column A (previously Input A)
- Column B (previously Input B)
- Column C (previously Input C - centerline)
- 2 traditional ‘Area Fill’ digitizing tools:
- Complex Fill - for parallel fill of simple or complex areas
- Complex Turning Fill - for turning stitching of simple or complex areas (previously Fusion Fill)
- 4 specialty fill tools:
- Star stitching of circle/oval
- Ring stitching of circle/ovals
- Manual Stitch and Triple Manual

## Independent stitch types for traditional digitizing tools

Column Fill tools default to Satin stitch and will automatically remember this or any other fill stitch you choose for them, independently of Area Fill tools.

Area Fill tools default to Tatami stitch and will automatically remember this or any other fill stitch you choose for them, independently of Column Fill tools.

The Run Tool is always set to Run Stitch type. It does not change to the other outline stitch types. So you can swap between the Graphics digitizing tools (e.g. Digitize Open Shape) for all outline stitch types, and quickly return to Run tool for travel runs without changing stitch type.

## Best of both worlds in ES Designing and ES Digitizing

EmbroideryStudio e4 maintains and improves on the advantages of the traditional approach to digitizing while also offering the increased flexibility and ease of use of the graphics approach to digitizing. Mix and match to suit each case. Use traditional style digitizing tools:

- for the dedicated run stitch tool, especially for travel runs between objects
- for digitizing column fills in any of 3 methods - A, B, or C
- for digitizing complex fills parallel or complex turning fills
- for specialty stitch techniques such as manual stitch, star and ring, backtrack & repeat.

Use graphics style digitizing tools:

- for digitizing open or closed shape outlines with the wide variety of outline stitch types
- for creating generic shapes such as rectangle, circle, standard shapes – for outline or fill
- for converting between outlines and fills
- for creating vector objects.
