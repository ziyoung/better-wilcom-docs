# New EMB Job Order Details

EmbroideryStudio e4 software now stores basic embroidery job order information and design status right in the EMB design file. Together with the new Design Library system, this provides a practical and simple method of recording and managing custom embroidery jobs without the complications of a full order database system.

It is a simple approach oriented mainly for ‘Custom Logo’ type of commercial embroidery, where a custom design is required to be stitched of a specified garment in a defined location for a customer order.

## A Production Job is one design on one garment

A ‘production job’ in the ES Job Order system is defined as:

- a specific embroidery design
- to be stitched on a specified Product, in a defined Position
- for a specified Order Quantity, broken down by Color / Size / Quantity
- for an order # for a specific customer on a specific order date.

A customer order might sometimes need multiple ‘production jobs’. If so, you use a separate EMB design file for each ‘job’ in the order. To see all jobs for a specific order, you can list designs by order # or customer, etc.

## Create and Manage Design Requests, Estimates, Approvals, Design Status

You can choose to enter values for the job Order fields, and then use Design Library to organize workflow for design requests, estimating, quoting, approval, scheduling, design status.

- Basic Design Requests with Artwork and Requested Details
- Advanced Design Requests with Garments and Logo Placement
- Improved Product Visualizer to visualize a design on a garment for an order
- Improved Design Approval Form
- Estimate Design Run Time and Job Time
- Use Design Status for Internal Workflow for Design Digitizing and Approvals

The EMB Order Job Feature is not a commercial order entry or production management database system. It uses the ES ‘design management system’ to view production job and order information saved with the EMB design. This allows custom embroidery jobs to be managed indirectly via the designs they use, without the complications or cost of a commercial database system.
