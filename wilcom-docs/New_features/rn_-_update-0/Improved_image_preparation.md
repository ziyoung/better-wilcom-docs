EmbroideryStudio provides ready access to cropping and touch up functions. The functions are still available from the Graphics menu but can now be readily accessed from the Auto-Digitize toolbox. The Crop Background tool opens a new Crop toolbar which in turn provides ready access to all cropping functions. [See also Preparing artwork for digitizing.](../../Automatic/bitmaps/Preparing_artwork_for_digitizing)

The new Adjust Bitmap function allows you to adjust image lightness and contrast, primarily for use with the new Color PhotoStitch tool. See below.
