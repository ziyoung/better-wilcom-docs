# Improved vector & bitmap auto-digitizing

EmbroideryStudio e4 offers improved auto-digitizing both from CorelDRAW Graphics and from Wilcom Decoration. Wilcom bitmap auto-digitizing uses the same techniques as the API, with more user control over parameters.

## Better image processing

- New Instant Smart Design provides one-step bitmap auto-digitizing
- Auto-determination of turning stitches for general shapes as well as fonts
- Improved auto-determination of appropriate stitch types and fill methods for generated objects
- Better quality results and fewer complex fill segments
- Default fill angle changed to 45°.

## Improved vector auto-digitizing

EmbroideryStudio e4 now provides direct conversion of vector graphics from within Wilcom Decoration. Key features:

- Ability to select vector objects in Wilcom Decoration and choose to auto-digitize them directly
- Same vector shape conversion and mapping as now from CorelDRAW Graphics
- Mapping of vector object properties to embroidery object properties
- Mapping of gradient colors to solid colors
- Optionally designate objects for different types of digitizing – e.g. turning fills vs complex fills, etc
