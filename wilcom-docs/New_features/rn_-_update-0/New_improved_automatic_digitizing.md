# New & improved automatic digitizing

EmbroideryStudio e4 offers major improvements in automatic digitizing. In particular, note the improvements in the practicability and quality of auto-digitized artwork for commercial use:

- Auto-digitize in EmbroideryStudio from bitmap or vector formats without relying on CorelDRAW Graphics.
- Enjoy better control of embroidery effects used in different objects.

EmbroideryStudio also includes the new Color PhotoStitch, provided as as part of Photo Flash add-on Element for specialty and custom photographic work.
