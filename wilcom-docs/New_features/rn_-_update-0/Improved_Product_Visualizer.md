# Improved Product Visualizer

A major improvement is made in EmbroideryStudio to the Product Visualizer – means to display a design on a garment or other product being embroidered. The key points are:

- New high resolution predefined product articles supplied in ES e4
- Defaults to ‘Blank’ 100 x 100mm embroidery area displayed in white. Resize and/or re-color if desired.
- Easier to select and use product images
- Locate product images anywhere in the design window
- Resize product images graphically or numerically
- Re-color product images
- Save product images in the EMB design file for viewing on any Wilcom system.
