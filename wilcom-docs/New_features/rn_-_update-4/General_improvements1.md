# General improvements

The ES e4.5 software update includes the following general improvements…

## Processing speed

EmbroideryStudio e4 provides significant speed improvements. Processing of large complex designs containing many objects is now up to 100 times faster. This is especially significant when processing large sequin designs.

## Installation improvements

EmbroideryStudio e4 provides significant improvements when installing updates and upgrades in relation to:

- Merging of existing custom assets
- Merging of existing settings when choosing to merge earlier installed versions.

User-defined assets such as styles, bling, sequin palette settings, toolbar layouts, and so on, are now correctly carried across from ESe3 and earlier installations.
