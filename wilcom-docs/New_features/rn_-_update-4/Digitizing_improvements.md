## Thread chart colors unexpectedly turning to red and black

Problems have occurred in EmbroideryStudio e4 with thread chart colors turning to red and black shades following editing operations. This seems to have affected two Madeira charts in particular. The problem has been resolved with the release of ES e4.5.1.
