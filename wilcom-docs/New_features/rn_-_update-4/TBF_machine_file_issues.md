## Color sequence in TBF files

A problem has been reported in relation to color sequence in TBF files. When exporting a design containing more than 72 color changes or stops, the color sequence is incorrect. This problem has been resolved with the current update which now allows up to 256 color changes. Note, however, TBF format has a limit of 256 color changes. If the design exceeds this, EmbroideryStudio will now display the following warning:
