Tip: Before using the Bead tools, you need to choose a suitable [machine format](../../glossary/glossary). Only some machine formats support beading – e.g. Tajima TBF, Dahao and SWF Twin Sequin. Refer to your machine manual for information about support for this type of decoration. [See also Bead encoding & decoding.](../../Applied/beading/Bead_encoding_decoding)
