# Sequin improvements

The ES e4.5.4 software update provides the following improvements in relation to sequins…

## Changing machine formats while digitizing sequins

A problem has been reported when changing machine formats while digitizing sequin runs. This problem occurs after resizing a Sequin Run object or regenerating stitches after changing machine formats – e.g. Barudan FDR-II Twin Sequin. Pressing Undo can cause the object to disappear or crash the software. This problem has been resolved with the current update.
