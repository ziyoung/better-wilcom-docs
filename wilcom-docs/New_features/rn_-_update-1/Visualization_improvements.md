# Visualization improvements

The ES e4 Update 1 enhances and corrects a number of visualization functions.

## Stitch Player works with ZSK

| ![StitchPlayer.png](assets/StitchPlayer.png) | Use View > Stitch Player to simulate embroidery design stitchout on screen. |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Stitch Player has been enhanced to work with ZSK files. It now provides the option of stopping at color changes in the same way as ZSK (formerly ZANGS) embroidery machines would act. [See also Simulate design stitchouts.](../../Basics/view/Simulate_design_stitchouts)

## Viewing bling

| ![ShowBling.png](assets/ShowBling.png) | Use View > Show Bling to toggle bling display on/off. |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |

The Show Bling command was missing from the ES Digitizing product level. It has now been included. [See also Bling Digitizing.](../../Applied/bling/Bling_Digitizing)

## Reshaping objects on a 4K screen at 200% scaling

A number of issues have been reported when reshaping objects on a 4K screen at 200% scaling:

- Unable to reshape a manual or manual triple run object. Node points are not shown.
- Unable to reshape an individual motif dropped with Use Motif.
- Unable to reshape a manual sequin object.

These problems have been rectified.
