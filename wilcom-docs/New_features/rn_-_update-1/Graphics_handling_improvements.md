# Graphics handling improvements

The ES e4 Update 1 enhances and corrects a number of graphics handling issues.

## CorelDRAW X8 64-bit installation in Graphics mode

When switching to CorelDRAW Graphics mode, the software previously warned (erroneously) that CorelDRAW X8 was not installed. This problem has been rectified.

## Undoing bitmap modifications

Problems were reported when attempting to undo repositioning or transformation of large bitmaps inserted into the software via CorelDRAW Graphics mode. This has been rectified.

## Undo actions between Wilcom Decoration and CorelDRAW Graphics

Problems were reported when undoing actions after switching between Wilcom Workspace and CorelDRAW Graphics. These have been rectified.
