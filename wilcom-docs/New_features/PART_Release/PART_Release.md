# What’s New in EmbroideryStudio e4?

EmbroideryStudio e4 contains many new product features and enhancements to many aspects of the software since the release of ES e3\. The EmbroideryStudio e4 user interface uses the same layout as e3 with some improvements. The software introduces a new ‘graphics style’ of embroidery digitizing while also improving on the professional ‘traditional’ digitizing methods. Graphical digitizing is standard in ES Decorating while both graphics and traditional digitizing are standard in ES Designing and ES Digitizing.
