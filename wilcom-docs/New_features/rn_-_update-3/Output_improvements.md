## Unwanted removal of small stitches

Problems have been reported with the unwanted removal of small stitches when saving to machine file format (DST, U01, U03, etc), even when Remove Small Stitches is set to ‘Never’. This causes problems in delicate objects such as small lettering. This problem has been resolved in ES e4.2\. [See also Eliminating small stitches.](../../Quality/quality/Eliminating_small_stitches)
