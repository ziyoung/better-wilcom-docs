2Select the Display Hoop checkbox.

3Select a hoop type from the list.

4Click OK.

Tip: If you resize a design to fit inside the hoop, stitches may be stacked on top of each other and pull the fabric. You can avoid this problem by reducing the number of crossovers to single (2 threads) for both fills and outlines. You can also use a thinner weight thread.
