# Opening ES Cross Stitch

Cross stitch design involves a different digitizing technique to ordinary embroidery design. For this reason, ES Cross Stitch has its own Design Window which you open from within EmbroideryStudio.

## To open ES Cross Stitch...

- Run EmbroideryStudio.
- Select File > Cross Stitch. The ES Cross Stitch Design Window opens.
