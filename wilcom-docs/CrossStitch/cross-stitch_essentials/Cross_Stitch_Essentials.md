# Cross Stitch Essentials

Cross stitch design involves a different digitizing technique to ordinary embroidery design. For this reason, ES Cross Stitch is a separate application to the main EmbroideryStudio application. It also has a different work environment with different settings for design size and density. Like the main application you will do most of your work with digitizing backdrops. Design viewing is also different to EmbroideryStudio.
