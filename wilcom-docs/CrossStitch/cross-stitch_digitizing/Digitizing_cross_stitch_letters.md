As with EmbroideryStudio, ES Cross Stitch lets you add lettering to a design by typing it directly in the Design Window. Use the Font dialog to select font, size and style. Select either outline or fill to digitize letters. Once typed, you cannot edit letters. Each letter is treated as a stitch block.

Tip: Lettering in ES Cross Stitch may appear thicker than the original TrueType font. This is generally due to ‘ClearType’ font smoothing which is turned on by default in Windows Vista or later. Temporarily turning off ClearType produces better lettering in ES Cross Stitch although this may affect its appearance in other applications.
