As an alternative to Cross Stitch Run, you can digitize a single stitch or line of stitches with the Pencil tool. Depending on the stitch type you select, you can also set the stitch direction.

## To digitize a single stitch or line...

1. Click the Single Line or Full Cross icon. If you are using Full Cross, the currently selected cross stitch type applies.

2. Select a color from the color palette.

3. Click the Pencil icon.

4. Click a square to make a single stitch, or click and drag the pencil to make a line. Press Ctrl and drag to draw straight vertical lines.
