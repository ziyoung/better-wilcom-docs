# Digitizing with cross stitches

ES Cross Stitch provides the full range of cross stitch types which you can use to create outlines and fills of any color. You can also control the orientation of fractional cross stitches to create different patterning effects. You can also adjust the density of individual cross stitches by stitching them once, twice or three times.
