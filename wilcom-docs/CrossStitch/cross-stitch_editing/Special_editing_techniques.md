# Special editing techniques

ES Cross Stitch provides a number of editing techniques which are especially helpful for cross stitch digitizing. You can clone a selection for re-use as a ‘rubber stamp’ and fill large areas with motifs or special composite stitches. You can combine fractional cross stitches in a variety of ways. You can also add a cross stitch border or a single line border, or both, to areas of a design.
