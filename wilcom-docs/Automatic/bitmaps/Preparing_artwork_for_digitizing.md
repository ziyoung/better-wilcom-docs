# Preparing artwork for digitizing

EmbroideryStudio allows you to crop [bitmap](../../glossary/glossary) images prior to use. You can also open images directly in third-party bitmap editing packages or use in-built CorelDRAW® Graphics Suite. Within EmbroideryStudio you can set general properties such as size and position. You can also scale and transform [bitmap](../../glossary/glossary) images although it may be best to do this during scanning.

Note: CorelDRAW Graphics provides the latest CorelDRAW® Graphics Suite drawing tools. These offer techniques for inserting and manipulating bitmap images, including vector tracing. [Vector objects](../../glossary/glossary) can then be converted to embroidery designs. [See also Operating modes.](../../Basics/basics/Operating_modes)
