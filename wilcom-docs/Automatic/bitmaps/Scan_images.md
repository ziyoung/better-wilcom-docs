# Scan images

You can scan images directly into EmbroideryStudio for use as digitizing [backdrops](../../glossary/glossary). The scanning feature in EmbroideryStudio allows you to use most [WIA](../../glossary/glossary)\-compatible scanners. You can use any scanning software provided that it can save the image in one of the compatible formats.

::: tip
You can also scan in your own textured backgrounds to see what a design will look like on real fabric. Fabrics can be scanned to provide full, centered, backgrounds to your design, or as small samples which can be tiled to fill the screen.

## To scan an image...

1. Set up your scanner.

2. Prepare the artwork for scanning.

3. Select File > Scan Graphic.

4. Choose a scanning mode and resolution. If you are scanning a fabric background, set the scan to 256 colors, 100% and 72 dpi (dots per inch). These settings will give a small file which will display well on your screen without taking up too much disk space or memory.

5. Preview the image in the scanning program.

6. Select the area to be scanned and scan the image.

7. Save the scanned picture in a compatible format picture file to your My Designs folder.

::: info Note
Scanned drawings are [bitmaps](../../glossary/glossary) and must be saved separately from the design file or they will be lost when you close the design.
