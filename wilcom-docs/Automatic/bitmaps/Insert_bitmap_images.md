2Navigate to the graphics folder. The dialog defaults to ‘All graphic files’ which displays all supported file types, bitmap and vector.

3Filter the Files of Type list as required – e.g. ‘BMP’.

Note: While ‘All graphic files’ includes both vector and bitmap formats, for native CDR and other vector file types, use the CorelDRAW® Graphics Suite import function.

4Select a file and click Open.

5Scale and transform the image on-screen or via the Property and Transform toolbars.

Tip: Use Auto Trace To Vectors to create [vector](../../glossary/glossary) outlines from [bitmap](../../glossary/glossary) images. You can then convert these to embroidery objects using a variety of input methods. Auto Trace To Vectors can find holes in shapes – both inside and outside boundaries are detected.
