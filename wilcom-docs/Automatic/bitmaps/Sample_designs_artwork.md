# Sample designs & artwork

EmbroideryStudio contains hundreds of ready-to-stitch designs, including attractive ornaments, samples and digitizing [backdrops](../../glossary/glossary). Design files (EMB files) and images (BMP, JPG, and WMF files) can be found in your Embroidery and Picture libraries.

The most valuable thing you can do when starting out is to spend some time exploring these designs and getting to know what’s available. EmbroideryStudio includes its own Design Library design management application to view and manage your embroidery designs. Alternatively, explore design folders using File Explorer. [See also Design Management.](../../Management/manage_designs/Design_Management)
