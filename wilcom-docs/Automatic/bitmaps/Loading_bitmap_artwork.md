# Loading bitmap artwork

Bitmap images of different formats can be scanned or ‘loaded’ into EmbroideryStudio for use as digitizing [backdrops](../../glossary/glossary). You can scale and transform them after importing but it is generally better to do so during scanning. Scaling afterwards may distort the image.
