You can load [vector](../../glossary/glossary) artwork of various formats via CorelDRAW Graphics for use as digitizing [backdrops](../../glossary/glossary) for manual or automatic digitizing. You can also use this technique to insert bitmaps.

::: info Note
CorelDRAW® needs to be registered before it can be used by EmbroideryStudio. Registration provides CorelDRAW® Standard Membership which gives you access to content – clipart, fonts, stock photos, templates – via Corel CONNECT.

5. Choose a digitizing technique:

- Convert [vectors](../../glossary/glossary) to embroidery: [See Convert objects with CorelDRAW Graphics for details.](../automatic/Convert_objects_with_CorelDRAW_Graphics)
- Switch to Wilcom Workspace and use the artwork as a digitizing backdrop: [See Digitizing methods for details.](../../Digitizing/input/Digitizing_methods)

::: info Note
If you cannot see the image you loaded in Wilcom Workspace, make sure Show Vectors icon is toggled on.

::: tip
Locking [backdrop](../../glossary/glossary#backdrop) images holds them in place as you digitize, transform or reshape the embroidery objects near them. Locked objects can be unlocked for modification at any time.
