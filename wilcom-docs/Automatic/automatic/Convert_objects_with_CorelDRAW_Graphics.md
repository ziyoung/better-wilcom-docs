Some EmbroideryStudio product levels include CorelDRAW® Graphics Suite as standard. This lets you convert [vector objects](../../glossary/glossary) directly to [embroidery objects ](../../glossary/glossary)via CorelDRAW Graphics. You can also convert embroidery to vector objects. Individual objects or whole designs can be converted. Bitmaps can also be used.

## To convert graphic and embroidery objects...

- Open a vector or embroidery design, depending on which mode you are working in – CorelDRAW Graphics or Wilcom Workspace.

The Convert function is located on the Mode toolbar. Behavior depends on the operating mode:

- In CorelDRAW Graphics, selected [vector objects](../../glossary/glossary) are converted to embroidery and displayed in Wilcom Workspace.

- In Wilcom Workspace, selected [embroidery objects](../../glossary/glossary#embroidery-objects) are converted to vector objects and displayed in CorelDRAW Graphics.
- If you want to keep a copy of the original vector objects, click the Keep Graphic Objects toggle in CorelDRAW Graphics.
- Use the Match to Embroidery Palette tool to toggle on/off thread color matching.
- When turned on, converted vector objects are assigned the nearest matching thread color in the current color palette.
- When turned off, a new thread color is added to the palette based on the vector color.
- Optionally, activate Tag Fill as Turning Satin. This produces a branched object as shown below.
