# Filtering stitches & functions

You can use the Stitch List to help locate stitches and machine functions for editing. The Stitch List displays stitch number, stitch coordinates, [stitch length](../../glossary/glossary#stitch-length), stitch function, stitch color. When you select a stitch in the list, it is simultaneously selected in your design.
