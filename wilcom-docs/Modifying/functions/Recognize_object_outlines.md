New or revised object outlines can be [recognized ](../../glossary/glossary)after stitch edits have been made. This is useful with machine files which have been opened without Object/Outline recognition. You may do this to preserve the original stitching in most of the design, while modifying a single section of it. You may also want to turn edited stitches into an embroidery object in order to preserve the edits.

## To recognize object outlines...

1. Click the Stitch Edit icon and select the individual stitches you want to process.
