# Editing machine functions

Most [machine functions](../../glossary/glossary) are inserted automatically whenever you select commands or specify [object properties](../../glossary/glossary#object-properties). They are stored with the embroidery object and updated whenever it is modified. However, EmbroideryStudio lets you insert machine functions manually. Depending on the current [machine format](../../glossary/glossary#machine-format), different functions are available. The most common types are described below. See your machine manual for further details. [See also Embroidery machine formats.](../../Basics/basics/Embroidery_machine_formats)

::: warning Caution
Machine functions which are manually inserted into non-manual objects – e.g. [Column A](../../glossary/glossary), [Complex Fill](../../glossary/glossary), etc – need to be maintained manually. If an object’s stitches are regenerated for any reason, manually inserted machine functions may be moved to another point in the stitch sequence. For this reason, only insert functions manually if they cannot be added automatically.
