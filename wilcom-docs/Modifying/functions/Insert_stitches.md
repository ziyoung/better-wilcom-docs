# Insert stitches

| ![StitchEdit00022.png](assets/StitchEdit00022.png) | Use Stitch > Stitch Edit to insert stitches in an object. |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |

You can insert stitches in an object to fill gaps. Inserted stitches are considered part of the object. They will, however, be lost if the objectâ€™s stitches are regenerated. Where possible, edit [object properties](../../glossary/glossary) rather than individual stitches. For example, to increase stitch density, reduce spacing rather than insert stitches.

## To insert stitches...

1Click the Stitch Edit icon and zoom into the area you want to edit.

2Select a needlepoint.

3Move the mouse pointer where you want to insert the new stitch, and right-click.

Note: Inserting stitches is different from creating stitches using the Manual input method. With this tool you create a separate object, with its own properties and [connectors](../../glossary/glossary).
