# Converting stitches to objects

By default, machine files are converted to outlines and objects upon opening. If you only want to convert selected parts of a design, you can open the file without object/outline recognition and process only the required stitch blocks. If you want to scale a design, edit an outline or change a stitch type, then the design or selected elements must be first converted into ‘[objects](../../glossary/glossary#objects)’.

::: tip
To ensure object outlines, stitch types, stitch density and colors are correct, it is always a good idea to check and edit designs after conversion. To improve the quality of a machine file, it is often better to edit stitches before conversion. [See also Opening machine files.](../../Production/convert/Opening_machine_files)
