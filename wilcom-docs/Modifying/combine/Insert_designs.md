EmbroideryStudio lets you insert one design into another. The two (or more) designs can then be saved as a combined design. When you insert a design into another, the two [color palettes](../../glossary/glossary) are combined. Colors with the same RGB values are automatically identified as having the same thread color. If you want to preserve them as separate colors, you need to change one or other before importing.

Tip: If you don’t know the origin of a design you are editing, you can insert it into a blank design file so that it acquires known fabric settings.

## To insert designs...

1Open the source design.

2Optionally, travel to the position in the [stitching sequence](../../glossary/glossary) where you want to insert the design. Otherwise, the inserted design will be placed at the end of the stitching sequence.

Note: The Options > General tab provides another setting – ‘Match to palette’ – which matches inserted design colors to the current palette.
