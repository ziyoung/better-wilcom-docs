Lock objects to prevent them from being moved or modified by accident. For example, locking [backdrop](../../glossary/glossary#backdrop) images holds them in place as you digitize, transform or reshape the embroidery objects near them.

## To lock or unlock objects...

- Select objects and click the Lock icon or press K.

[Selection handles](../../glossary/glossary) disappear, indicating that the object can no longer be selected or modified.

- To unlock objects, click the Unlock All icon or press Shift+K.

::: tip
The Color-Object List provides an easy way to select objects in designs and access their [properties](../../glossary/glossary#properties). Use it to group, lock, and hide objects.
