# Auto-sequence entire designs

The Optimize Color Changes feature improves the quality and efficiency of the stitchout by minimizing the number of color changes and trims. All existing overlaps are preserved by the operation. Grouped objects are not ungrouped but different colored objects are optimally sequenced regardless of grouping.

## To auto-sequence an entire design...

- Open or create a design and select objects to resequence.
