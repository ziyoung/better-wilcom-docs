- Holding down Ctrl, select subsequent objects. Select each object in the order you want it to stitch out. Do this directly on-screen or via the Color-Object List.
- With objects still selected, select Arrange > Sequence > By Selects or click the Sequence by Selects icon. The objects are resequenced in the selection order.
