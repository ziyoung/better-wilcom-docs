Group objects, or an entire design, to keep them together for moving, [scaling](../../glossary/glossary#scaling) and transforming actions. With grouped objects you can also apply global changes, saving time and ensuring consistency. When you have finished making changes to a group, you can ungroup and work with the component objects.

## To group or ungroup objects...

- Select objects and click the Group icon or press Ctrl+G.

Selected objects are combined. This group can be selected, moved, resized and transformed as a single object.

::: tip
The Color-Object List provides an easy way to select objects in designs and access their [properties](../../glossary/glossary#properties). Use it to group, lock, and hide objects.
