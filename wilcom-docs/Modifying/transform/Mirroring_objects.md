# Mirroring objects

Fashion and textile designs often use copied and mirrored design elements. In EmbroideryStudio you can mirror objects horizontally or vertically by means of the Transform toolbar. You can also mirror around a defined axis using a reference line.

::: tip
The Mirror Merge tools allow you to duplicate and transform selected embroidery objects, as well as merge them into a single object. This feature is often used in making fashion or textile designs. [See Mirroring & reflecting selections for details.](../productivity/Mirroring_reflecting_selections)
