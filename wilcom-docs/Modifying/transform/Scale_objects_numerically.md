# Scale objects numerically

You can scale artwork, selected objects or a whole design by means of [object properties](../../glossary/glossary#object-properties). With [design files](../../glossary/glossary) ([EMB](../../glossary/glossary)), this allows stitches to be regenerated while preserving the original stitch density. An exact size may not be achieved due to [pull compensation](../../glossary/glossary#pull-compensation) being added to stitches after scaling operations.

::: warning Caution
If you scale a machine file by more than Â±10%, however, changes to stitch density will affect the design quality.

## To scale objects numerically...

1. Select the objects or design to scale.

2. In the Property Bar, either:

- Enter an exact height and width, or
- Enter the new height and width as a percentage of current dimensions.
