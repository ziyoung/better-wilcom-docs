# Splitting objects

EmbroideryStudio lets you split [branched objects](../../glossary/glossary) – monograms, appliqués, lettering, etc – into their components. You can even split [](../../glossary/glossary#HT%5Fmanual%5Fobject)manual objects with Process Stitches in order to convert sections to outline objects.
