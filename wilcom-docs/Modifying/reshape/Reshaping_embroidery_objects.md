# Reshaping embroidery objects

The reference points you mark when digitizing a shape become its ‘[control points](../../glossary/glossary)’. Most control points can be added, deleted, or moved. Corner and curve points can be swapped. Some, such as [entry ](../../glossary/glossary)and [exit](../../glossary/glossary) points, cannot be deleted.
