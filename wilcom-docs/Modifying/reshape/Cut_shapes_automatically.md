The Automatic Knife tool assists semi-automated digitizing of vector artwork. When objects have clean boundaries, EmbroideryStudio fragments them automatically and generates good quality stitching in most cases. It also operates on Complex Fill and Complex Turning embroidery objects.

For each source object, EmbroideryStudio:

- Creates turning-stitch objects as well as single-angle objects where appropriate.
- Creates overlaps at junctions between objects.
- Branches adjoining objects.
