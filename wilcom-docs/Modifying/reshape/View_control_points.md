The Reshape Object tool is important in EmbroideryStudio. Use it whenever you want to change object shapes. Use it also to edit stitch angles as well as [entry ](../../glossary/glossary)and [exit](../../glossary/glossary#exit) points.

## To view control points...

- Select an object and click Reshape Object. [Control points](../../glossary/glossary) appear together with Reshape Views toolbar.

::: tip
Most control points can be added, deleted, or moved. Corner and curve points can be swapped. [Entry/](../../glossary/glossary)[exit](../../glossary/glossary#exit) points, however, cannot be deleted.
:::

- Use the Reshape Views toolbar to selectively display control points.
