# Mirroring & reflecting selections

The Mirror Merge tools allow you to duplicate and transform selected objects, as well as merge them into a single object. Use them to create wreaths or decorative borders. Or use them to create perfectly symmetrical objects. Color blocks are automatically resequenced to minimize unnecessary color changes.
