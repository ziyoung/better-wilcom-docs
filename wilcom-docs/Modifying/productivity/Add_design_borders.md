::: tip
By selecting individual objects, you can add borders to these rather than the entire design.

2. Select a border and adjust Border Width as required. The default is 3.00 mm.

3. Click OK.

4. Edit borders in the normal way â€“ change thread color, adjust border size, etc.

::: tip
By default, borders scale proportionally. To resize proportionally around a central anchor point, hold down Shift as you drag. To scale freely in vertical and horizontal planes, hold down Ctrl as you drag.
