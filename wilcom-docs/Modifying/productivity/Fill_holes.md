- To cover holes exactly, accept the default value of 0.00.
- To leave a gap between the filled holes and the original object, enter a negative underlap – e.g. \-1.00.
- To overlap the filled holes and the original object, enter a positive underlap – e.g. 1.00.

3. Click OK. All newly created objects are filled with the current fill stitch settings, stitch angle and thread color. Each new object is an independent object and is placed immediately after the source object in the stitch sequence.
