In addition, EmbroideryStudio provides powerful tools for mirroring and reflecting selections or entire designs for the creation of decorative wreaths or borders. The same toolset can be used to create perfectly symmetrical objects or designs. Alternatively, create arrays of designs, such as badges, automatically resequenced for faster stitchout.
