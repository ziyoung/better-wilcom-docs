# Advanced Embroidery Lettering

![AdvancedLetteringSample.png](assets/AdvancedLetteringSample.png)EmbroideryStudio provides a variety of advanced editing techniques for fine-tuning lettering designs. Add special characters and symbols as desired. By default, lettering objects are filled with Satin. Apply other basic fill stitch types as with all embroidery objects.

Specify the sequence in which letters are stitched to minimize registration problems. The automatic kerning feature improves lettering appearance and legibility by fine-tuning spacings between character pairs. Alternatively, fine-tune letter spacing according to the number of characters per lettering object. This is particularly useful with Asian fonts. Lettering appearance and quality can be improved by the correct selection of underlay. Apply Envelope effects to lettering objects to make them bulge or arch, stretch or compress.
