You can specify the sequence in which letters are stitched to minimize registration problems such as on caps or difficult fabrics. For example, the Center Out option is especially useful when stitching on caps. There are also options for multiple lines of lettering which are useful for machines without trimmers.

## To adjust letter sequencing...

1. Right-click the Lettering icon or double-click selected lettering object/s to access object properties.
