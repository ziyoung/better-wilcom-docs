# Setting stitching sequence & join method

You can specify the sequence in which letters are stitched to minimize registration problems such as on caps or difficult fabrics. While the Closest Join method is recommended in most cases to minimize trims, you may sometimes want to use the As Digitized setting with fonts which include multiple colors, multiple stitch types, or special effects.
