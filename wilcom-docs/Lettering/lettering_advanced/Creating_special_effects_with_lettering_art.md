Apply Lettering Art effects to make letters bulge or arch, stretch or compress. Many styles are available from the Lettering Art gallery. You can fine-tune preset shapes as preferred. Edit lettering text in envelopes the same way as normal lettering. Return lettering to its original shape by removing the envelope altogether.
