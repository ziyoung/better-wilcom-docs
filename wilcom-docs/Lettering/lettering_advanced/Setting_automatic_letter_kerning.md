# Setting automatic letter kerning

The automatic kerning feature improves lettering appearance and legibility by fine-tuning spacings between character pairs. Typically, spacing between certain pairs looks uneven due to the optical illusion formed by mixing straight lines with curves. Automatic kerning optimizes spacing between lettering pairs according to preset values. While it works very well without customization, advanced users can customize these values as they wish. Kerning tables can even be copied from similar MS WindowsÂ® fonts.
