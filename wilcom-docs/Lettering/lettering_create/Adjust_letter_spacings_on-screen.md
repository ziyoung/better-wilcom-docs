Spacing between letters is calculated automatically as a percentage of letter height. In most cases the [default](../../glossary/glossary) spacing is adequate. Sometimes you may want to control the overall letter spread to fit a particular location. Similarly, you can change the space between lines in a multiple-line lettering object using the Reshape Object tool. Sometimes spacing between certain letters may appear too large or too small, depending on the shape of neighboring letters. To compensate for this visual effect, you can move one or several selected letters closer or further apart along the baseline to improve spacing.

## To adjust letter spacings on-screen...

- Select the lettering object and click the Reshape Object icon.
