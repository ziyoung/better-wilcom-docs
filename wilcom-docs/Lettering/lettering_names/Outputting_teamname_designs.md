# Outputting teamname designs

You can create individual designs from each name in a teamname design. Alternatively, you can create a matrix of names optimized for batch stitching.

For output, you can generate machine files consisting of:

- Both design and names
- Design in one file and names in another, or
- Design and names in individual files.
