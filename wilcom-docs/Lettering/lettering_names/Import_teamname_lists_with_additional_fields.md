A ‘size’ field is often added to teamname lists even though it does not form part of the design. While the size field doesn’t appear in the design, it is added to each design name when generated. This allows machinists to ensure they are using the right size garment for the specified name.

To view size fields in the Manage Teams dialog, first save the teamname file in CSV or TXT format to the Teamname Teams folder as shown. Don’t use sub-folders.
