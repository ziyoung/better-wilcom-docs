# Create teamname objects

| ![TeamNames.png](assets/TeamNames.png) | Use Toolbox or Docker > Team Names to associate multiple names with a design. |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

To associate team members with a design, you create a variable ‘teamname object’. Either key in the names of the team members directly, or import from a list provided by the customer.

## To create a teamname object...

- Open the design you want to use.

- Click the Team Names icon to access the docker. By default, the teamname object will consist of a single baseline with three names.

- If you are happy with the default layout, simply click a cell and start typing. Press Tab or Shift+Tab to move back and forth through name fields.
- Alternatively, use the Teamname List tools to add names, delete names, etc:

::: tip
When you import a teamname list you can import it from anywhere. However, you cannot use the Manage Teams dialog effectively with it unless it is saved in the ‘Teamname Teams’ system folder. [See Managing teams for details.](Managing_teams)
:::

- Click the Name Order button if you want to change the default naming order. Use it, for example, to put surnames first or limit which names are included – e.g first and third.

- Click OK and enter reference points as prompted.
