# Team Names

The Team Names feature lets you create designs with multiple names. For example, you can use the same logo with different names for sports teams or corporate uniforms, without having to create multiple copies of the same design. Depending on how you want to stitch out, you can choose to save and stitch names and designs separately, or together.
