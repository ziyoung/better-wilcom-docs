# Modifying lettering

When you first create lettering, it may be too big or too small. Size can be adjusted interactively or by adjusting object properties. Lettering objects can also be skewed and rotated.

Tip: The size of lettering will determine the type of underlay you need to apply. Lettering with heights under 5 mm should not have underlay. Letters 6 mm to 10 mm can have a center-run underlay applied. Lettering larger than 10 mm is large enough for edge-run underlay.
