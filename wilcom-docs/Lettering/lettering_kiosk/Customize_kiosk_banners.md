Like the kiosk Design folder, the default kiosk banner is located within the EmbroideryStudio folder structure. If you want to modify the banner in any way – e.g. with a specific location name – it is a simple matter to access the banner and update it. Alternatively, you can copy the modified banner to a separate location on your kiosk hard disk or network location and reference it there. If you have more than one kiosk set up, they can all reference the same banner.

## To customize the kiosk banner...

1. Navigate to the ‘Kiosk’ folder of your EmbroideryStudio e4 installation:

C:\\Program Files\\Wilcom\\EmbroideryStudio_e4.0\\Kiosk\\

Here you will find the default kiosk banner – dimensions 1200 x 100 pixels.

2. Customize the banner as required:

- Either replace the current image with one of the same dimensions.
- Edit the current banner in any graphics or paint program and save to the same location.
- Copy the banner to the same or another location and edit as desired.

If you move the banner to another location, you need to update the software settings as follows:

3. Click the Options icon or select Setup > Options. Click the Kiosk tab.

5. Select the custom banner file and click Open. This then becomes the default banner which the kiosk will reference.
