- When you are satisfied with the design, press a Send to Machine button. A separate button is present for each machine configured on the system.
- Press Start Again to create another design. The current design is automatically saved to the watching folder with a filename equal to text name.

Note: If the operator does not press Start Again but instead selects a new design layout, the new design overrides the current one, preserving any typed text.

- To exit kiosk mode altogether, press the lock icon. Normally you are prompted for a supervisor password.
