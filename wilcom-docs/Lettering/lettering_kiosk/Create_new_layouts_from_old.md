To create custom design layouts is not very different to setting up thread colors. The simplest approach is to base a new design on an existing one in order to preserve stitch settings and design scale. You can change colors, fonts and stitch settings as required.

## To create a new layout from an old one...

1. Click the Open icon. The Open Design dialog opens.

Alternatively, specify your own folder.

3. Select a design to edit and click Open.

4. Before you do anything else, select File > Save As and save the design under a different name.

5. Double-click the design to open its properties.
