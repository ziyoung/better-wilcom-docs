It’s a simple matter to include a design backdrop to your design layout – e.g. a cap.

## To include a design backdrop...

- Click the Product Visualizer icon. The docker appears.

- Select a product image – e.g. cap – and set color as desired.
- Set the lettering object position to zero (0,0) as shown. This will ensure that the lettering layout automatically centers itself in the allowable stitching area.

- As the lettering object and stitching boundary may not be in the correct position for the backdrop, click the Auto Start & End icon and digitize a start and end point as shown.

Note: The stitching boundary is locked in the template. It has to be unlocked to be moved.

- When you are happy with the result, click Save.

The file must be saved to the EmbroideryStudio e4 Designs folder:

C:\\Program Files\\Wilcom\\EmbroideryStudio_e4.0\\Kiosk\\Designs

Alternatively, set your own designs folder.

- The design will appear in the kiosk design chooser when you next run it.
