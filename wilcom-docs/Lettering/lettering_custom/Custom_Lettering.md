# Custom Lettering

Turn any TrueType font installed on your system into an embroidery font. Sometimes you find that you want to reshape a letter to improve its appearance, perhaps to suit a particular lettering height. EmbroideryStudio lets you save the letter as an alternative version. You can even create custom fonts or modify an existing font for special applications. Even merge letters from two or more fonts.
