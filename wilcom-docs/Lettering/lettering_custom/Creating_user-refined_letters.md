# Creating user-refined letters

Sometimes you find that you want to reshape a letter to improve its appearance, perhaps to suit a particular lettering height. EmbroideryStudio lets you save the letter as an alternative version. In fact you can save multiple versions of the same letter within the same font. Each version can have a unique height range. When using the letter in a design, the height setting will automatically determine which version is used. The feature thereby allows you to permanently record fixes to particular lettering problems and thereafter automatically apply them.

::: info Note
The software preserves all user-refined letters when a new version is installed. Only factory default letters are overwritten.
