# Creating custom fonts

EmbroideryStudio provides methods for defining custom embroidery fonts. You can digitize letters from [backdrop](../../glossary/glossary) images, convert [vector objects](../../glossary/glossary), or digitize freehand using any of the input method tools. You can use [artwork](../../glossary/glossary) from sources such as calligraphy books. You can also copy characters and symbols from the MS WindowsÂ® Character Map into an external graphics program. Here you can modify them as you like, save them to a graphics file, and use it as a design backdrop. [See also Use the Character Map.](../lettering_advanced/Use_the_Character_Map)

Note: You can also create new embroidery fonts by converting TrueType fonts. [See also Converting TrueType fonts to embroidery.](Converting_TrueType_fonts_to_embroidery)
