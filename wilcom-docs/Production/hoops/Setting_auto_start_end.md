Before stitchout, some embroidery machines require you to position the hoop precisely in relation to the needle. The Auto Start & End feature is available to connect first and last stitches in a design. This makes it easy to position the needle before stitching, and reduces the chance of the needle hitting the side of the frame.

::: info Note
Machines which auto-center designs around design extents will ignore the Auto Start & End setting.
