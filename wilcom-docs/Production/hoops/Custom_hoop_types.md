## Multi-position hoops

Three-position and sliding hoops allow large designs to be split manually and stitched without the usual registration problems. Sewing fields are in fixed positions with known dimensions, making it easy to register objects stitched in each position. In the software, they are displayed as colored rectangles â€“ red, blue, or green. Define your own multi-position hoop according to the dimensions of the hoop you are using.
