# Troubleshooting EmbroideryConnect

If experiencing problems using the EmbroideryConnect device, double check that it connects to the WiFi and EmbroideryHub correctly.

- The Power and WiFi LEDs on the EC device will be both on and solid if connected.
- If they flash briefly and then fade out, the EC device is not connected.

If a mistake lies in the configuration settings, simply start again and double-check the settings.
