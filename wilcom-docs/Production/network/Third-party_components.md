## WiFi router compatibility requirements

Note the following WiFi router requirements to be compatible with the EC device:

| Requirement                        | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Standard security protocol         | The WiFi router must use one of the standard security protocols: WEP or WPA/WPA2 Personal. Security type ‘none’ or ‘unsecured’ is not supported at present. A WiFi password is mandatory.                          |
| Support for WLAN Protocol 802.11 G | The WiFi router needs to support WLAN Protocol 802.11 G in the 2.4 Ghz band. The EC device will not connect to a WiFi router using the 5 Ghz band. If unsure, consult the documentation provided with your router. |
| WiFi network name                  | You must know the WiFi network name (SSID) and WiFi router password (key). We recommend using a SSID (network name) that contains only alphanumeric characters – letters and numbers.                              |
| WiFi coverage                      | WiFi coverage must be sufficient to serve the entire production area.                                                                                                                                              |
