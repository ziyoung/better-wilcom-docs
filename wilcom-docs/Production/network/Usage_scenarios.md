# Usage scenarios

There are two basic ways of setting up an EmbroideryConnect network using either a single PC or multiple PCs.

## Scenario 1: Single PC

If you are using a single PC to create, edit, and manage your designs as well as serve machine files to your embroidery machine/s, you will need both EmbroideryStudio and EmbroideryHub running.

## Scenario 2: Multiple PCs

If you are using two or more PCs to create your designs and a dedicated PC to serve your machine files, you will need:

- EmbroideryStudio with EmbroideryHub running on PC 1.
- EmbroideryStudio running on PC 2, PC 3, etc.

Design files may be saved anywhere on your network. These are sent to the EmbroideryHub where they are converted to machine files and sent to the EmbroideryConnect network.
