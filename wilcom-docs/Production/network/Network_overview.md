It is an ideal solution for small to medium size embroidery manufacturers. EmbroideryConnect is designed to meet the following usage requirements:

- EmbroideryStudio user wants to be able to send a design from PC directly to a nominated machine.
- EmbroideryStudio user wants to ‘push’ a design to a queue for eventual production.
- Machine operator wants to ‘pull’ a nominated design to embroidery machine from the design queue.
