3Save a copy of the firmware update file to the EmbroideryHub PC. This will have been sent to you or downloaded from the [Help & Support](http://help.wilcom.com) site. Firmware files have a ‘.WIL’ extension which is an encrypted format.

4Plug the EC device into the computer via the USB-C port located at the top.
