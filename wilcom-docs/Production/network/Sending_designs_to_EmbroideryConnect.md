# Sending designs to EmbroideryConnect

Once you have configured one or more devices on your EmbroideryConnect network, you have the choice of sending designs to a named device or ‘pushing’ them to a queue where they can be ‘pulled’ from the machine itself. You can use any PC running EmbroideryStudio on your local WiFi network to send designs.
