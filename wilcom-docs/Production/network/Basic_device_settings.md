Settings can be modified across the network. Double-click the device icon in the main window to access settings.

| Option                                  | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keep designs when powered off           | By default, designs stay on the device unless you remove them in the Manage Designs window. When unticked, designs are cleared from the device so they can’t be copied.                                                                             |
| Replace designs on barcode read request | When ticked, whenever the operator does a barcode scan to fetch a design, EmbroideryConnect will delete all existing designs on the device before transferring the scanned design. Some users only want one design on the device at any given time. |
| Apply to all                            | Click to apply the same settings to all EmbroideryConnect devices configured on the EmbroideryHub.                                                                                                                                                  |
