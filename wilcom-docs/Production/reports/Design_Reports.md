EmbroideryStudio allows you to customize information in the format you require. The printing capability also allows you to:

- Personalize worksheets with company name and logo
- Print approval sheets with or without design details
- Display the assigned hoop
- Visualize on selected fabric/garment
- Include selected colorways.

Optionally, email production worksheets in PDF format with the embroidery file as an attachment in a specified format â€“ e.g. EMB or DST, etc. Screen images may also be captured in PNG format to distribute designs for viewing in real colors.
