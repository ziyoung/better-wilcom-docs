# Printing design reports

EmbroideryStudio allows you to print designs in various predefined formats. The most common are the approval sheet and the production worksheet. Approval sheets are usually sent to the client for confirmation prior to production. The production worksheet is the link between designer and embroidery machine operator. It contains a design preview as well as essential production information, including design size, color sequence and special instructions. Reports can be output as hard copy or in electronic (PDF) format.

::: warning Caution
If certain thread colors are not available on your printer, they may be mapped to a different color, including white. Print the design in TrueViewâ„¢ color, or black and white, or turn off color mapping. See your printer manual for more information.
