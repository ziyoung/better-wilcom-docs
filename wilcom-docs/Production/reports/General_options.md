The General tab includes the following layout settings:

| Option                | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text / heading font   | Set parameters for all text and headings appearing in the report – e.g. Arial for print, Verdana for online reports.                                                                                                                    |
| Print in English      | Useful when printing to plotters where the device driver does not support the character set you require. Deselecting the checkbox prints the report in the language of the operating system.                                            |
| Print design filename | Include the filename of the current design in the header of the product report.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Margins               | Add a margin between the edge of the page and the content of the report. The page size itself is set via the Print dialog.                                                                                                              |
| Company               | Include your company name on the report. Enter a name and/or attach a company logo. If you have already entered one or more company names into the system, select from the droplist. Optionally, print the logo on the first page only. |
| Order information     | Include customer name and order details.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
