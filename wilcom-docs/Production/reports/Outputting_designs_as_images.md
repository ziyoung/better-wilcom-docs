# Outputting designs as images

Designers frequently want to distribute their designs for viewing in real colors, in TrueView™ or otherwise, with or without fabric backgrounds. This might be for stock design sales purposes, for approval of digitized designs, or for presentation on the web or in catalogs. Screen images are captured in PNG format because it supports transparency.

## To output a design as an image...

1. Open the embroidery design.

2. Select File > Capture Design Bitmap.
