# Embroidery Production

![e4_Sample09.png](assets/e4_Sample09.png)Design processing and encoding involve all the important, back-end operations of embroidery design and manufacture. This is where you actually output your designs to machine, disk, printer, cutter, and so on. For this, you will need an understanding of embroidery file types as well as different machine formats. Depending on your setup, you will also need an understanding of traditional storage media such as embroidery disks.
