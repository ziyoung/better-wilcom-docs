# Exporting designs for machine

Different embroidery machines understand different languages. Each has its own control commands. Before you can stitch out a design, it must be in a format which can be interpreted by the machine. Machine or ‘stitch’ designs are low-level formats for direct use by embroidery machines. They contain only stitch coordinates and machine functions. They are generally created on-the-fly when sending designs to machine. Or they are converted when saving to disk or memory stick.

Note: The Design Library conversion function allows you to batch-convert to and from all EMB and other supported design file types. It also batch-converts many machine file formats such as DST, EXP, SEW. [See also Converting designs.](../../Management/manage_designs/Converting_designs)
