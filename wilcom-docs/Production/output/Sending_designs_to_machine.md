# Sending designs to machine

EmbroideryStudio provides alternative means for sending designs directly to machine. Depending on your software options, you can stitch to machine using Stitch Manager, Machine Manager, or Connection Manager. Newer machines use USB or Wired-Wireless network connections. EmbroideryStudio supports these connections via the Connection Manager. Older-style machines generally use serial port connections. EmbroideryStudio supports connection to these machines via the Stitch Manager.

::: info Note
Machine Manager and its operations are described in a separate supplement.
