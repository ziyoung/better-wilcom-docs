Newer machines use USB or Wired-Wireless network connections. They can appear as a disk drive or be setup to read designs from a folder on the PC. Some machines such as Janome MB-4 and Barudan LEM are supplied with propriety connection software. EmbroideryStudio supports connection to these machines via Connection Manager. Each machine connection:

- Has a unique name and ‘quick-access’ button
- May have a unique folder to which designs can be sent. From here they can be accessed from the machine control panel or third-party connection software.

## To send a design to Connection Manager...

- Ensure that the target machine is correctly connected to your PC. See your machine documentation for details.
- If a connection already exists, click the quick-access button to send the design to a predefined location.

- If a connection already exists, the dialog opens.
