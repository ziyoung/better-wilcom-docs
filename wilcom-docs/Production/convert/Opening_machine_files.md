# Opening machine files

If you want to scale a design, edit an outline or change a stitch type, then the design or selected elements must be first converted into ‘[objects](../../glossary/glossary#objects)’. By default, machine files are converted to outlines and objects upon opening. Open options should reflect how the design was originally digitized, not how you want it now. Experiment with the settings to get the best results.

::: tip
To ensure object outlines, stitch types, stitch density and colors are correct, it is always a good idea to check and edit designs after conversion. To improve the quality of a machine file, it is sometimes better to edit stitches before conversion.
