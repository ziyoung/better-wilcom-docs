# Create a color-merge TXT file

Auto color merge reads and interprets a TXT file containing colors from a named thread chart. You can create this text file manually with a text editor such as MS Notepad. The text file must have the same file name as the CND file â€“ e.g. Fish.TXT and Fish.CND. Both files must reside in the same folder. For the Auto color merge function to work correctly, information in the text file must be entered in a certain format. A typical text file might look like this:
