# Reading Melco CND design files

Melco Condensed (CND) is the native file format of Melco embroidery digitizing software. CND files store only digitized outlines and stitch values. When you open CND designs in EmbroideryStudio, these outlines are scaled and stitches recalculated to preserve density. EmbroideryStudio recognizes all Melco machine functions and stitch types, including Partition Lines and Complex Fill, and automatically converts them to [EMB](../../glossary/glossary) format. However, CND files do not contain specialty features such as [Pull Compensation](../../glossary/glossary) or [Auto Spacing](../../glossary/glossary), nor do they include actual stitches, thread colors, or design icons.
