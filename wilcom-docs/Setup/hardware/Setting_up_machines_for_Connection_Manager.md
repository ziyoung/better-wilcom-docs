# Setting up machines for Connection Manager

Newer machines use USB port connection. They appear as a disk drive on the PC. As such there is no need to set up communication parameters as for serial or parallel port connections. Some machines such as Janome MB-4 and Barudan LEM, are supplied with propriety connection software. To integrate with EmbroideryStudio, the relevant software needs to be installed on the same machine. Discuss with your machine supplier for details.
