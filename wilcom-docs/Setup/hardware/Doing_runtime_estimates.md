# Doing runtime estimates

EmbroideryStudio provides a Runtime Analyst feature for calculating estimated running times for embroidery files using specified RPM values and other runtime parameters. These are used on a design-by-design basis to determine scheduling, running costs, and payments for production staff. Output can be used by any third-party software such as ERP or accounting systems.

## Typical usage

Information can be made available to various stakeholders for payroll, estimations, and scheduling. For instance:

- The designer creates a new design and saves as EMB and/or machine file such as U11.
- EmbroideryStudio automatically calculates running time.
- Calculated results are saved to CSV file in a designated file location.
- The payroll department accesses the CSV file and calculates pay rates for the design. For example:
- A payroll clerk may need to find out what the runtime will be for a given job in order to pay the machine operator.
- A manager may need to provide an accurate runtime estimate for any given design so the payroll department is able to process machine operator payments.
- The ERP system accesses the CSV file for estimation and scheduling purposes.
- Runtime information may be communicated to a machine operator who needs to know the runtime estimate for a specific job.
