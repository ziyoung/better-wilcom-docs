PC serial COM ports are male connectors, and can be either 9-pin or 25-pin. They are named COM1, COM2, COM3, etc. When you set up a digitizer or machine that is connected via a serial port, you need to enter the serial port settings in EmbroideryStudio.

Note: You must be able to identify the ports on your computer. If in doubt, consult a PC technician.
