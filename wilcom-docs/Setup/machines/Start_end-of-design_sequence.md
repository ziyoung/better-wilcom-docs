# Start/end-of-design sequence

In addition to an End of Design function, some machines require extra [empty stitches](../../glossary/glossary) and [empty jumps](../../glossary/glossary) in order to stitch the start and end of a design. Other machines require a Stop function. Depending on the machine type, you may also require functions to initialize the machine or trigger a [frame-out](../../glossary/glossary) after stitching.

Where available, the Set Needle Number option initializes the machine and brings the head back to the first color change needle position.
