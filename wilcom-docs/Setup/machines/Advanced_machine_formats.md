# Advanced machine formats

The Advanced tab provides access to additional machine format options. Again, the available settings depend on the selected machine format. You can set the color change sequence, insert special codes for start or end of a design, and enter speed settings. There are also miscellaneous settings, including whether to change fabric tension during boring, and whether to rewind tape when stitching is complete. Use the Machine Format Settings dialog to define values to allow when outputting to a specific machine format.

Note: Not all values described here are available for all machine formats. Use these instructions to enter values that apply to your selected format. Only change Advanced values if you are familiar with the codes used by your embroidery machine. See your embroidery machine manual for more information.
