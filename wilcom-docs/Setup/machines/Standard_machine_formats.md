# Standard machine formats

Different machines require different settings. When you select a machine format, EmbroideryStudio uses it to translate digitized designs into a specific machine-readable form. Common formats include Barudan, Brother, Happy, Marco, Meistergram, Melco, Pfaff, Stellar, Tajima, Toyota, Ultramatic and ZSK. Typical modifiable values include stitch and jump length, trim functions and color change functions.

Note: Not all values described here are available for all machine formats. See your embroidery machine manual for details.
